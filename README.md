# What's This?

Some of my notes, mainly about physics, mathematics and computer sciences, most of which are in Chinese, others in English.
Some of them are course notes.

<del>I'm considering transferring some notes into Markdown, because it will be </del>
It's not possible to use Markdown to write anything serious about physics in the foreseeable future, 
since a typical article on physics contains a lot of *funny colorful pictures* like Feynman's diagrams, 
which are usually created by TikZ, and it really sucks to replace them with SVG or even worse, bitmaps.
Considering cross-document references can be implemented with `xr-hyper` or similar packages, 
it doesn't make any sense to write in Markdown.

# There is something wrong ...

As expected - I'm no expert in any of these fields. 
Feel free to open issues.

# The license?

DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
