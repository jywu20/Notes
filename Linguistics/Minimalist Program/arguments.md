## Tense, Force, Mood
Mood: imperative, indicative, subjunctive

Force: interrogative, declarative

## Coordinating Structures

## Expletive pronouns
There be

It is ... to 

## Clauses are TPs

A nominative subject implies presence of a T.

### Argument via coordinating
For clauses with out an explicit T, we argue there are hidden abstract T in their structures.

`He enjoys syntax, and has learned a lot.`

`He` [[<sub>?</sub> `enjoys syntax`] `and` [<sub>T'</sub> `has learned a lot`]]

### Argument via cliticisation

They have seen a ghost. They've seen a ghost.

They have their car serviced regularly. *They've their car serviced regularly.

The contrast indicates in the second group of sentences, there is something intervening `They` and `have`, blocking cliticisation.

## Clauses are CPs

### Infinite clauses

`She wanted more than anything for him to apologize.`

`What she wanted was for him to apologize.`

Question:
The "for sb to do sth" structure may be, at the first glance, be analysed as 

[<sub>clause</sub> [<sub>PP</sub> `for sb`] [<sub>TP</sub> `to` [<sub>VP</sub> `do sth`]]]

Nonetheless, observation from passivization rejects this hypothesis. 
*`You aren't intended for to hurt anyone.`

## Argument via tag questions


## Asymmetry of coordinating
The following sentence

`He could have helped her, or she could have helped him.`

can be rephrased into a shortened form:

`He could have helped her, or she have helped him.`

While we have

`*He have helped her, or she could have helped him.`

## "Deleted" constituents are not removed from the tree

`He could have helped her, or she have helped him.`

`*He could have helped her, or she've helped him.`

An invisible constituent intervenes "she" and "have", rendering cliticisation impossible.

## DP and QP
We claim that all nominal phrases are DPs or QPs, explicit or implicit. 

For definite nominal expressions:

We linguistics take ourselves/\*yourselves/*themselves too seriously, don't we/\*you/\*they?

Linguistics take \*ourselves/\*yourselves/themselves too seriously, don't *we/\*you/they?

So person features are decided by the determiner. A determiner selects appropriate NP as its complement.

For indefinite nominal expressions:

Eggs and many dairy products cause cholesterol.

I'd like toast and some coffee please.

I wrote poems.

I wrote poetry.

*I wrote poem.

I wrote enough poems.

I wrote enough poetry.

*I wrote enough poem.
