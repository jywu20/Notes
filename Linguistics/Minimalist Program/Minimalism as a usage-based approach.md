# Comparison with more descriptive approaches

The version of minimalist syntax described here is almost a binary ICA in traditional grammar, with the only difference being that the minimalist syntax here is *derivational*, while ICA is more "static", and that the minimalist syntax described here is not directly about the surface structure. 
We can expect a future convergence between generative syntax and more typological-functional works.

# Important authors

Here is a list of important authors and their articles regarding the status of generative syntax.

- GUGLIELMO Cinque
- Matthew S. Dryer
  - Frederick J. Newmeyer, Possible and probable languages: a generative perspective on linguistic typology. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. Pp. x+278. Book review.
    - I think Dryer made a mistake here because basic linguistic theory is not really an explanatory theory
