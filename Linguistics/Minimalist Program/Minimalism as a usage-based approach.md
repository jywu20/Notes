# Comparison with more descriptive approaches

The version of minimalist syntax described here is almost a binary ICA in traditional grammar, with the only difference being that the minimalist syntax here is *derivational*, while ICA is more "static", and that the minimalist syntax described here is not directly about the surface structure. 
We can expect a future convergence between generative syntax and more typological-functional works.
