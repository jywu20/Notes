# Notes of Analyzing English Sentences

## Questions found

- How can verbs be classified according to their syntactic features? For examples: unaccusative, unergative, OC, ECM, raising structure and so on
- What are clitics and how do they work?
- Can Merge have access into inner structures of phrases it merges? Or, does it simply depend on categorical labels of phrases?

## Verb phrase structure
- unergative verb
- unaccusative verb

## Clause structure
- indicative clause
- subjunctive clause

## Expletives
- *it*
- *there*

### Phi-features they carry
*it*: [3-number, single-person]

*there*: [3-numbers]

Such specification about the two expletives' features are made because of the following data:

*There are a few tourists on the mountain.*

*There is a tourist on the mountain.*

*It is said that he has taken bribes.*

**It are said that he has taken bribes.*

*It is said that they have taken bribes.*

**It are said that they have taken bribes.*

### Rules of their usage

(p.364) Expletive Conditions (revised)

#### (i) External Argument Condition:

An expletive can only be merged as the last/highest argument of a light verb with
no external argument (i.e. in spec v).

#### (ii) Indefiniteness Condition:

Expletive *there* can only be merged as the specifier of a light verb whose VP
complement has an indefinite nominal or pronominal internal argument.

#### (iii) Inactivity Condition:

Expletive *it* can only be merged as the specifier of a light verb which does not
c-command any accessible nominal or pronominal expression with some active
case or phi-feature(s)

# Verb

I want Mary to come to Japan and for her to see my parents.

Some verbs are that-deletion verbs or for-deletion verbs:

`*She wanted for him to apologize.`

`She wanted him to apologize.`

This may be a consequence of the complementizer being cliticized to the verb, giving a null spellout of the complementizer.
