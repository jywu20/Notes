An analysis of "the more, the more" construction in English
======

This is a reading note of Comparative Correlatives in English: A Minimalist-Cartographic Analysis by Eiichi Iwasaki and Andrew Radford

# Why the construction is important 

"The more, the more" construction, or Comparative Correlatives (henceforth CC), was raised as an example of an idiosyncratic idiom that cannot be analyzed within generative syntax.
This article tries to show otherwise: that the construction can indeed by analyzed from a Minimalist-Cartographic perspective.

# Asymmetry between the two clauses

First we note that the two clauses in [the more ...]<sub>C1</sub>, [the more ...]<sub>C2</sub> are actually asymmetric, with the first being a modifier to the second.

From the fact that if the whole CC is subjunctive, then C2 is subjunctive and C1 is not:

> It is imperative that / I demand that 
> 
>(a) the more John eats, the more he pay(s)
>
>(b) *the more John eat, the more he pay(s)

Also, when forming a tag question, it is C2 that is questioned:

>(a) The more we eat, the angrier you get, don't you?
>
>(b) *The more we eat, the angrier you get, don't we?
>
>(c) *The more we eat, don't we, the angrier you get?

So we can conclude that C2 is the main clause, and C1 is its modifier.

For many speakers, the subordinate clause can be subjunctive
> (a) The more intractable a problem be, the more difficult it is to solve
> 
> (b) *The more intractable a problem is, the more difficult it be to solve

Compare the following example:
> (a) However intractable a problem be, it can usually be solved
> 
> (b) Intractable though the problem be, it can be solved

In more formal styles of English, we have 
> The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced 
> 
> The more you praise him, the more willing will he be to cooperate (Fillmore 1989: 24-25) [emphasis added]

# Problems in Taylor's (2006) analysis

Taylor (2006) analyzed CC as 

[the<sub>C</sub> [ [more ...]<sub>comparative</sub> [it is]<sub>TP</sub> ]<sub>FP</sub> ]<sub>CP1</sub>,
[the<sub>C</sub> [ [more ...]<sub>comparative</sub> [it is]<sub>TP</sub> ]<sub>FP</sub> ]<sub>CP2</sub>

This analysis has several severe problems. 

First, *The* is not a complementizer elsewhere.

Second, in this analysis *the* and the comparative phrase do not form a constituent. However, we have 
> (a) I think that in all probability they'll read a lot
> 
> (b) *The in all probability more I read, the more I understand

and
> (a) I think that - and this is really important - John is going to resign
> 
> (b) *The - and this is really important - more I read, the more I understand
