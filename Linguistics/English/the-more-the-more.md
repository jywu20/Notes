An analysis of "the more, the more" construction in English
======

This is a reading note of Comparative Correlatives in English: A Minimalist-Cartographic Analysis by Eiichi Iwasaki and Andrew Radford

# Why the construction is important 

"The more, the more" construction, or Comparative Correlatives (henceforth CC), was raised as an example of an idiosyncratic idiom that cannot be analyzed within generative syntax.
This article tries to show otherwise: that the construction can indeed by analyzed from a Minimalist-Cartographic perspective.

# Asymmetry between the two clauses

First we note that the two clauses in [the more ...]<sub>C1</sub>, [the more ...]<sub>C2</sub> are actually asymmetric, with the first being a modifier to the second.

From the fact that if the whole CC is subjunctive, then C2 is subjunctive and C1 is not:

> It is imperative that / I demand that 
> 
>(a) the more John eats, the more he pay(s)
>
>(b) *the more John eat, the more he pay(s)

Also, when forming a tag question, it is C2 that is questioned:

>(a) The more we eat, the angrier you get, don't you?
>
>(b) *The more we eat, the angrier you get, don't we?
>
>(c) *The more we eat, don't we, the angrier you get?

So we can conclude that C2 is the main clause, and C1 is its modifier.

For many speakers, the subordinate clause can be subjunctive
> (a) The more intractable a problem be, the more difficult it is to solve
> 
> (b) *The more intractable a problem is, the more difficult it be to solve

Compare the following example:
> (a) However intractable a problem be, it can usually be solved
> 
> (b) Intractable though the problem be, it can be solved

In more formal styles of English, we have 
> The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced 
> 
> The more you praise him, the more willing will he be to cooperate (Fillmore 1989: 24-25) [emphasis added]

# Problems in Taylor's (2006) analysis

Taylor (2006) analyzed CC as 

[the<sub>C</sub> [ [more ...]<sub>comparative</sub> [it is]<sub>TP</sub> ]<sub>FP</sub> ]<sub>CP1</sub>,
[the<sub>C</sub> [ [more ...]<sub>comparative</sub> [it is]<sub>TP</sub> ]<sub>FP</sub> ]<sub>CP2</sub>

This analysis has several severe problems. 

First, *The* is not a complementizer elsewhere.

Second, in this analysis *the* and the comparative phrase do not form a constituent. However, we have 
> (a) I think that in all probability they'll read a lot
> 
> (b) *The in all probability more I read, the more I understand

and
> (a) I think that - and this is really important - John is going to resign
> 
> (b) *The - and this is really important - more I read, the more I understand

Finally, we have 

> The more chocolate *that* you eat, the quicker you put on weight

Since the first clause is a single clause, *that* must be its complementizer, and therefore the correlative *the* is not a complementizer.
This may be explained alternatively by assuming [*that you eat*] is a relative clause, but this is again unlikely, because we don't have (dubious: we can find similar sentences on COCA)

> *The more people to whom you talk, the more problems into which you get.

This explanation also does not explain what role *the* in C1 takes, and why we have displaced *the more* phrases.

# *The* as a degree operator

It's instructive to see that outside CCs, *the* can serve as a degree operator.
In COCA, we can find *all the better*-like adjectival phrases.
It's also instructive to notice that a degree operator can be moved to the edge of a nominal expression:

> I've never had quite so unpleasant an experience
> 
> It was rendered an all the more delicate situation by the presence of the President

TODO: why only *all the more* in ordinary clauses?

It can be expected A-bar movement to the edge of CP can also happen in a clause under certain circumstances.
That's exactly what happens in the CC construction: we can assume the QP [*the more chocolate*] is moved from TP to SpecFocP.

# The relation between C1 and C2

The last question is the relation between C1 and C2. Phenomena requiring explanation:
- Why C1 is always before C2, and 
- Why we never see a single *the more*

The second question can be answered by thinking the two *the more* phrases as correlatives, and the first question can be answered by assuming the first sentence to be a topic. Since TopP cannot be spell out with an arbitrary order, so are C1 and C2.
