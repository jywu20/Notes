\title{Reading notes of Cambridge Grammar of English Language}
\author{Jinyuan Wu}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This note is a reconstruction of the contents \acl{cgel} (\citealt{cgel}, henceforth \acs{cgel}). 

\section{Theoretical preliminaries}

For the discussion on the underlying theoretical framework, 
see the relevant chapter in \href{../Chinese/main.pdf}{this note}.
Briefly speaking, the framework is coarse-grained Minimalism:
invisible functional heads are erased,
but dependency relations created by the functional projections are kept (\prettyref{fig:coarse-grained}(a)),
and the corresponding \ac{cgel} tree is obtained by replacing the name of dependency relations 
by syntactic function-form pairs (\prettyref{fig:coarse-grained}(b)).
The head is defined as the dominant \emph{lexical} word.
This makes \ac{cgel} look like old-fashioned X-bar theory, 
where a lexical word projects into a phrase (\ac{cgel} \citesec{5.2} [5]),
but there can be several ``maximal projections'' headed by the same lexical word (\ac{cgel} \citesec{5.2 [11]}).
This is actually consistent with Minimalism (\prettyref{fig:cgel-minimalism}).

The standard of ``lexical'', however, varies from one author to another.
A PP and a CaseP (in generative terms) are similar objects,
but in the coarse-grained \ac{cgel} framework,
the latter is definitely an NP, 
but the status of the first is kind of controversial:
should we recognize the preposition as a lexical word,
or as a functional word?
In the first analysis, a PP in generative terms is still a PP,
while in the second analysis, a PP in generative terms is an oblique NP.
Choosing between the two analyses is merely a problem of notation.
But it is good practice to choose a notation that hints the readers about 
certain properties of the construction in question.
For example, if a PP is analyzed as a PP, then probably the preposition has some predicative properties.

    \label{fig:cgel-minimalism}
\end{figure}

Not all dependency relations can be expressed purely by the context-free phrase structure grammar 
\citep{pullum2008expressive}. 
Movements (or cross-serial dependencies in dependency terms) in Minimalism 
are represented by a gap (\ac{cgel} \citesec{2.2} [5]),
or by indirect dependency (\ac{cgel} \citesec{5.14.1}).

The close relation between \ac{cgel} and generative syntax apparently deviates 
from the common descriptive practice, 
especially the common descriptive framework extracted and summarized 
by \citet{dixon2009basic1,dixon2010basic2,dixon2012basic3} and named as \ac{blt} by Dixon,
but this distinction is illusory:
while \ac{blt} assumes a flatter phrase structure,
information coded by the binary-branching phrase structure in \ac{cgel}
is coded by dependency arcs in \ac{blt} (\prettyref{fig:to-the-fat-man-blt}).

Though several disagreements with the mainstream generative syntax is raised in \ac{cgel},
and much more severe accusations are made in \ac{blt},
it can be seen all the three approaches are describing almost the same complexity class of grammars.

\section{The clause structure}

This section is about the phrase structure of the clause.
I will discuss clause dependents, 
their forms and functions,
grammatical systems in the clause,
and how everything is put together.

\subsection{Types of complements}

Clausal (or verbal, since the clause is headed by the verb) complements 
may be NPs and PPs, and less frequently, adverbs 
(as in \corpus{He treated us [kindly]}). % TODO: adverbial clause: the name and classification 

This section lists some criteria of classification of complements.
They are all discussed in \ac{cgel} \citesec{4.1.1}.

\subsubsection{Core v.s. oblique}

One classification standard is the make up of the complement.
A \concept{core} complement is a complement with similar morphosyntactic properties of NP complements.
A \concept{non-core} complement is a complement with similar morphosyntactic properties of PP complements.
If a non-core complement itself takes an NP complement (or something with similar morphosyntactic properties),
the latter is called an \concept{oblique}.

Note that in \ac{cgel}, the term \term{argument} is reserved for purely semantic objects.
A clausal complement is therefore the syntactic incarnation of an argument,
but itself is not an argument.
This is \emph{not} the way \term{argument} is used in \ac{blt}.

It should also be noted that in \ac{cgel}, the terms \term{non-core} and \term{oblique} 
are reserved for clausal complements and the NP part of PP clausal complements.
They \emph{do not} include adjuncts with similar forms.
On the other hand, in \ac{blt}, the term \term{peripheral argument} covers both complements and adjuncts.

The prototypical definition of \emph{core} and \term{oblique} complements 
are based on syntactic forms instead of functions,
while the definition is extended by analog with respect to syntactic functions.
Whether these terms are useful is a question we need to wait and see.

\subsubsection{External and internal}
