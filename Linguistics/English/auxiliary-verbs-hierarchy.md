Auxiliary verbs and syntactic cartography
======

This is a reading note of Deriving the Functional Hierarchy by Gillian Ramchand and Peter Svenonius.

This article is to explain why in English we have the following ordering of auxiliaries:

{T, Mod} < Perf < Prog < Pass < V (some argue that Mod < T - see 8.4 and 8.5 in Analysing English sentences by Andrew Radford)

The author shows that with the following list of ingredients:
1. syntactic Cartography heads (T<sub>PERF</sub> etc.)
2. Selectional rules between the heads
3. Default spell out rules, enabling spelling out a -ing affix when morphological merge is impossible. This can avoid inserting several heads with similar functions into the syntactic tree.
4. A constraint only in English: that modals exist only in a morphological form that includes a Fin* feature.

# Previous explanations and why they fail

## Purely semantic explanation

Schachter (1983) is a purely semantic explanation. We may claim that 
- the progressive is an incomplete instantiation of an action or state
- the perfect is a nonspecific relative past

Therefore, only *have been being done* is acceptable, because what is "being done" can happen in the past and is already finished.
Something happening in the past and having already been finished cannot be still "incomplete", so we don't have * *be having done*.

However, this explanation fails to account for the unacceptability of the following sentence:

> *John is having returned.

This sentence can be given a very coherent explanation: John is always in a status of "heaving returned":
whenever I gives John a phone call, it always turns out that John has just finished a trip and has already returned.
However, even in this explanation, the sentence is still problematic, and therefore there must be some "solidified" underlying constraints (i.e. syntactic constraints) prohibiting the occurrence of this sentence.

## Minimalist morphosyntactic explanations

- Arbitrary assignment of auxiliaries to functional heads
- Language specific selectional rigidities
- No cross-linguistic generalization
