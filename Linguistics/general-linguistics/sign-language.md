Sign languages
======

Some key points of Jeremy Kuhn's slides about sign language: Sign language linguistics, Part II: Syntax and semantics.

- Sign language has synchronous syntax
  - both in syntax and word compounding
  - an adverb can be realized as a non-manual morpheme occurring together with a constituents it modifies
  - making PSG trees about surface structure harder to draw (but this is not a problem in generative syntax: we can consider the non-manual morpheme as an abstract functional head)
  - NPs may be associated with locations in space 
    - This can eliminate the ambiguity in an NP like *coffee and tea or wine*: each constituent is assigned an locus, like [COFFEE<sub>a</sub> AND TEA<sub>b</sub> ]<sub>c</sub> OR WIND<sub>d</sub>, and then the speaker can say EITHER<sub>c/d</sub>
    - Maybe those indices in GB are really there.
    - Similarly, we have 
    > 'John<sub>i</sub> told Bill<sub>j</sub> that he<sub>{i/j}</sub> would win.'
    So loci are actually variable names
