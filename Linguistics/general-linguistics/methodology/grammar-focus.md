# Topics in syntax (and *informal* semantics)

## Inside a CP: The structure of clauses

Inside a CP:
- The CP layer(s)
  - [The function of the left peripheral](#structure-and-function-of-sentences)
- The TP layer(s)
- The vP layer(s)
  - [Argument structure](#argument-structure-of-verbs)

## Recursion involving CP

CP embedded into 
- [a subordinate clause of a sentence](#linked-clause) TODO: "that he is mad since he got so stimulated in that event" is a clause, yet it has one linking clause attached to it. What category will Dixon put it into? A sentence, or a clause?

## Distributed morphology

# Word classification



# Structure and function of sentences

A sentence is made by
- a [main clause](#main-clause)
- zero, one more more [linked clauses](#linked-clause)

A sentence has one of the following pragmatic function-related *mood*:
- a statement, with [declarative mood](#declarative)
- a command, with [imperative mood](#imperative)
- a question, with [interrogative mood](#interrogative)
  - a content question
  - a polar question, or in other words, a yes/no question (some languages lack "yes" and "no")

Note that the same meaning may be expressed by different *syntactic* moods. For example, *Would you mind ...* is interrogative but it actually is a command.

---
**Note** In generative linguistics, these *moods* are usually called *Force* to distinguish them from the indicative/subjunctive *Mood* (which is called *modality* in a more descriptive context).

---

The mood, if grammatically marked, is usually marked on the [main clause](#main-clause). TODO: how mood is marked 

## Declarative

Declarative mood is typically unmarked.

## Imperative

Imperative mood is often shown by a verbal suffix.

## Interrogative

An interrogative sentence may be marked by one or more features in the following:
- intonation
- word order change
- interrogative affix or particle

# Syntactic roles of clauses

The syntactic role of a clause may be
- The [main clause](#main-clause) in a sentence
- [Embedded clause](#embedded-clause) which looks like adjectives or nouns
  - [Relative clause](#relative-clause)
  - [Complement clause](#complement-clause)
- [Linked clause](#linked-clause) which are after conjunctions like ", and ..." in English
  - [Temporal clause](#temporal-clause)
  - [Contrast clause](#contrast-clause)
  - [Consequence clause](#consequence-clause)

## Main clause

A main clause is a clause which on its own makes up a sentence.

## Embedded clause

### Relative clause

A relative clause is a [modifier](#modifier). 

### Complement clause

A complement clause is an [argument](#argument-structure-of-verbs) in another clause.

## Linked clause

### Temporal clause


### Contrast clause


### Consequence clause

# Inner structure of clauses

A clause's inner structure may be
- a "complete" one, consisting of 
  - a predicate, typically a verb or including a verb or something like a verb
  - zero, one or more arguments
    - core arguments, which are either stated or easily inferred from the context 
    - peripheral arguments
- not "complete", with only some NPs

## Typical verb clause

A clause with a verb as its predicate has some possible structures (here we only list the core arguments):
- transitive, in which there is 
  - a transitive predicate
  - a transitive subject labeled as A
  - a transitive object labeled as O
- intransitive, where there is 
  - an intransitive predicate
  - an intransitive subject labeled as S
- extended transitive, where there is 
  - a extended transitive predicate
  - a transitive subject labeled as A
  - a transitive direct object labeled as O
  - an "indirect" object labeled as E (though the term is [problematic](./语言共性和语言类型（第二版）笔记.md#语法关系))
    - Note that the role of E may not be a typical dative argument. 
- extended intransitive, where there is 
  - a extended transitive predicate
  - an intransitive subject labeled as S
  - an extended argument labeled as E (example can be seen in Sec. 3.2 (9) in [Dixon's book](./basic-linguistic-theory.md))
