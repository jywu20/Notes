# Book1, Chapter 1

## 1.3

Though animals and plants can be classified by their most salient features, this cannot be done for languages, 
because 
- languages involving a large set of mutually independent components, and 
- languages can be fluid and can be between two prototypes; animals cannot.

We should note that the most simple and straightforward prototypical patterns are often found in 
small tribal languages. Making generalization from famous languages is often dangerous.

Some phonological universals:
- words starting with C are often more frequent than words starting with V
- since dorso-velar consonants back vowels require more work to pronounce, they tend to be missing 

## 1.4

The same term may be used in slightly different senses in different languages, because the grammar varies.
For example, some languages may have an *accusative* mark but it may not appear in a PP, while in Latin, 
a preposition sometimes takes an accusative object. Some languages distinguish singular, dual, trial, and
paucal pronouns, so the term *plural* has different meanings in languages with different number systems.
Different parts of the grammar may have different number systems (for example, the number systems of verbs
and pronouns may be different), and in this case terms like *plural* have different meanings within the same 
grammar, and therefore should be avoided.

## 1.6

Evidentiality can arise by language contact.

Language features connected to the lifestyle include
- pronouns
  - different pronouns corresponding different locations
  - harmonic/disharmonic: whether a group of people mentioned are in the same generation or not
  - honorification
- nouns
  - locative markers
- verb
  - Evidentiality

- Cultural influence
  - No "I want to do sth" in Pennsylvania German because one has to accept God's will and should not want something for themselves
  - Portuguese conceived as deficient by Tariana speakers because of lack of evidentiality
  - Amazonian habit to find a cause for every event may be connected to evidentiality.

An interesting fact is that people around the world often conceive a language as consisting of its vocabulary 
instead of its grammar. A tribe strictly forbidding any load words just lets "foreign" structural patterns invade 
its language. 

Languages with the most complex word structure tend to be spoken by only hundreds of or a few thousand people. 
Languages spoken by a large group tend to have less overall grammatical complexity, but the syntax may be fairly complicated.
(This may provide some evidence for the generative opinion of language acquisition?)

## 1.7

body parts, tense system

## 1.8

The author argues that no external evidence should be use to motivate some analysis of a certain construction in
a language. This goes in contrary to the methodology often seen in generative studies.

It should also be noted that if a word with meaning X is in the word class C1 in one language, a word in another language with a similar meaning to X may be in a word class very different with C1. 
For example, kin relationships can be described using verbs. So do the number "two".

## 1.9

The example of Dyirbal is very interesting, where noun class memberships are deeply associated with legends:
- Most birds are thought to be the spirits of dead human females and therefore are associated with femininity
- Animals and fishes have animacy and therefore are associated with masculinity
- The moon and sun are, in legend, believed to be husband and wife.
- Light and stars are associated with fire.

## 1.11

The category "case" may be split into the following features:
- the role of an NP in a sentence
  - the role as a certain kind of "core" argument
    - nominative-accusative system
      - nominative
      - accusative
    - ergative–absolutive alignment
      - ergative
      - absolutive
  - the role as a peripheral argument
    - locative
    - instrumental
- the role of an NP in another NP
  - genitive
  - comitative

It is possible that every lexical word in an accusative NP has an ACC mark, and the possessor in the large NP
itself has a GEN mark.

# 2

There are no key points. The chapter is worth a thorough reading.

## 2.3

Does everyone have the intuition that *i* is associated with short distance, and *u* is associated with long distance, and *a* is associated with mid-distance?

## 2.6

Useful reading list

## Sentence

A sentence is made by
- a [main clause](#main-clause)
- zero, one more more [linked clauses](#linked-clause)

A sentence has one of the following pragmatic function-related *mood*:
- a statement, with [declarative mood](#declarative)
- a command, with [imperative mood](#imperative)
- a question, with [interrogative mood](#interrogative)
  - a content question
  - a polar question, or in other words, a yes/no question (some languages lack "yes" and "no")

Note that the same meaning may be expressed by different *syntactic* moods. For example, *Would you mind ...* is interrogative but it actually is a command.

---
**Note** In generative linguistics, these *moods* are usually called *Force* to distinguish them from the indicative/subjunctive *Mood* (which is called *modality* in a more descriptive context).

---

### Declarative

Declarative mood is typically unmarked.

### Imperative

Imperative mood is often shown by a verbal suffix.

### Interrogative

An interrogative sentence may be marked by one or more features in the following:
- intonation
- word order change
- interrogative affix or particle

## Clause

A clause's inner structure may be
- a "complete" one, consisting of 
  - a predicate, typically a verb or including a verb or something like a verb
  - zero, one or more arguments
    - core arguments, which are either stated or easily inferred from the context 
    - peripheral arguments

Two frequent structures:
- transitive
  - a transitive predicate
  - a transitive subject labeled as A
  - a transitive object labeled as O
- intransitive
  - an intransitive predicate
  - an intransitive subject

The syntactic role of a clause may be
- [main clause](#main-clause)
- [embedded clause](#embedded-clause)
  - [relative clause](#relative-clause)
  - [complement clause](#complement-clause)
- [linked clause](#linked-clause)
  

### Main clause

A main clause is a clause which on its own makes up a sentence.

### Embedded clause

#### Relative clause

A relative clause is a [modifier](#modifier). 

#### Complement clause

A complement clause is an [argument](#argument-structure) in another clause.

### Linked clause

#### Temporal clause


#### Contrast clause


#### Consequence clause

### Argument structure

## Noun phrase

A noun phrase can be made up by 
- zero, one or more [modifiers](#modifier)

### Modifier

## Recursion

Recursion in a language includes
