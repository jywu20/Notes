# Book1, Chapter 1

## 1.3

Though animals and plants can be classified by their most salient features, this cannot be done for languages, 
because 
- languages involving a large set of mutually independent components, and 
- languages can be fluid and can be between two prototypes; animals cannot.

We should note that the most simple and straightforward prototypical patterns are often found in 
small tribal languages. Making generalization from famous languages is often dangerous.

Some phonological universals:
- words starting with C are often more frequent than words starting with V
- since dorso-velar consonants back vowels require more work to pronounce, they tend to be missing 

## 1.4

The same term may be used in slightly different senses in different languages, because the grammar varies.
For example, some languages may have an *accusative* mark but it may not appear in a PP, while in Latin, 
a preposition sometimes takes an accusative object. Some languages distinguish singular, dual, trial, and
paucal pronouns, so the term *plural* has different meanings in languages with different number systems.
Different parts of the grammar may have different number systems (for example, the number systems of verbs
and pronouns may be different), and in this case terms like *plural* have different meanings within the same 
grammar, and therefore should be avoided.

## 1.6

Evidentiality can arise by language contact.

Language features connected to the lifestyle include
- pronouns
  - different pronouns corresponding different locations
  - harmonic/disharmonic: whether a group of people mentioned are in the same generation or not
  - honorification
- nouns
  - locative markers
- verb
  - Evidentiality

- Cultural influence
  - No "I want to do sth" in Pennsylvania German because one has to accept God's will and should not want something for themselves
  - Portuguese conceived as deficient by Tariana speakers because of lack of evidentiality
  - Amazonian habit to find a cause for every event may be connected to evidentiality.

An interesting fact is that people around the world often conceive a language as consisting of its vocabulary 
instead of its grammar. A tribe strictly forbidding any load words just lets "foreign" structural patterns invade 
its language. 

Languages with the most complex word structure tend to be spoken by only hundreds of or a few thousand people. 
Languages spoken by a large group tend to have less overall grammatical complexity, but the syntax may be fairly complicated.
(This may provide some evidence for the generative opinion of language acquisition?)

## 1.7

body parts, tense system

## 1.8

The author argues that no external evidence should be use to motivate some analysis of a certain construction in
a language. This goes in contrary to the methodology often seen in generative studies.

It should also be noted that if a word with meaning X is in the word class C1 in one language, a word in another language with a similar meaning to X may be in a word class very different with C1. 
For example, kin relationships can be described using verbs. So do the number "two".

## 1.9

The example of Dyirbal is very interesting, where noun class memberships are deeply associated with legends:
- Most birds are thought to be the spirits of dead human females and therefore are associated with femininity
- Animals and fishes have animacy and therefore are associated with masculinity
- The moon and sun are, in legend, believed to be husband and wife.
- Light and stars are associated with fire.

## 1.11

The category "case" may be split into the following features:
- the role of an NP in a sentence
  - the role as a certain kind of "core" argument
    - nominative-accusative system
      - nominative
      - accusative
    - ergative–absolutive alignment
      - ergative
      - absolutive
  - the role as a peripheral argument
    - locative
    - instrumental
- the role of an NP in another NP
  - genitive
  - comitative

It is possible that every lexical word in an accusative NP has an ACC mark, and the possessor in the large NP
itself has a GEN mark.

# 2

There are no key points. The chapter is worth a thorough reading.

## 2.3

Does everyone have the intuition that *i* is associated with short distance, and *u* is associated with long distance, and *a* is associated with mid-distance?

## 2.5

The term *ergative verb* is not a good one. Compare the behavior of an "ergative" verb like *close* in an accusative language like English:
> The door closes.
> He closes the door.

and the case in an ergative language (e.g. Sec. 3.2, (8) and (10)), we can see that in a truly ergative language, the position of O is exactly the same as S, while even in a clause with an "ergative" verb in an accusative language, the position of O is not the same as S.
Therefore, beside the argument structure of the central verb, there must be something else that is different between an nominative/accusative language and an ergative language.
Thus the term *ergative verb* is unnecessary and misleading. 

## 2.6

Useful reading list

# 3

Since the framework introduced in this chapter will be used ubiquitously, I separated it into [a single file](./grammar-focus.md).

# 4

A problematic aspect in the methodology of many generative linguists is they just assuming one grammatical construction is in UG and try to fit observation data into this framework.
But as we know, the truly innate language faculty may be as small as several functional modules surrounding Merge, and we really cannot just expect we can find, say, complement clauses in every language.
We need to reject *linguistic analysis* in the above sense. Rather, we should keep previously observed constructions as *prototypes* that may appear or may not appear in the language in question, and check whether something in the newly described language looks close enough to one of these prototypes.
If so, we can, for example, label one construction as "complement clause". If not, we need to invent new terms to describe the construction.

## 4.2

### How to distinguish coordination and relative clause?

Semantics can be the golden standard when there is little evidence otherwise to support the existence of relativization. See (2), for example: "Their food was little. It was boiled." = Their food was little and it was boiled / Their food that was boiled was little.

### Ergative and instrumental case in Dyirbal

TODO

### English temporal clause 

The argument of the author can be reconstructed as follows:
- (8a) and (8b) have similar meanings and phonetic forms and should be analyzed similarly.
- In (8b), the main clause and the condition clause have a logical relationship and therefore should be considered as two independent clauses instead of one clause and an embedded clause into the former.
- So there is no embedding in (8b), and hence there is no embedding in (8a).
- Since (7c) and (8a) have exactly the same structure, there is no embedding in (7c).
- Since the relation between the temporal clause and the main clause is the same in (7a-c), we conclude there is no embedding in any of these sentences.
- And therefore, we conclude that a temporal clause is not embedded into the main clause.

But this line of argument has several problems:
- Why is the author so sure that if two clauses have a logical relationship, then they must be independent?
- How should he name the bracketed phrase in 
  > He testified [that Mary sang yesterday after locking the doors].

  Is it a clause? Or is it a sentence?

I think [Haspelmath's definition](https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1725) certainly makes more sense.

## 6.1

An important point to remember is to always compare things that can be compare. For example, suppose we are going 
to do a typological study on adjectives, and this of course involves word classification. 
Now suppose we already know three languages in which what are traditionally known as nouns, verbs and adjectives 
have properties listed in Table 6.1. We need to recognize the notion of "adjectives" when doing typology.

One possible way to do word classification is to apply criteria *eagerly*: for example, first, we classify *all* 
words that can be head of an NP as nouns, and then we classify *all* words that can be head of a predicate complex
as verbs, and then we classify what can be modifier within an NP as adjectives.
In this way, we classify "adjectives in language 1" as stative verbs and "adjectives in language 2" as quality
nouns. So only language 3 has adjectives.

Another way is to apply criteria spontaneously to each group of words, and if several criteria all work, choose 
the most important one (for example, we may assume that being able to be head of NP is more important than 
being able to be head of predicate complex, which in turn is more important than being able to be NP modifier).
In this way, all three languages have adjectives.

The above two word classification rules are all consistent, and we may go on to do typology according to one of 
them. Which approach is better is determined by what approach reveals more language universals.
However, it's often the case that a references grammar of language 1 uses rule 1 while a reference grammar of 
language 2 uses rule 2, so, if we are doing a typological work according to rule 2, and we mistakenly take the 
words of the reference grammar of language 1 literally, then we are only working with adjectives in language 2 
and language 3 and skip adjectives in language 1 (in the sense of rule 2).

That's why high quality typology requires high quality language documentation. If the reference grammar of language
1 is detailed enough, we will find what is called as stative verbs can also be classified as adjectives (in
the sense of rule 2) because, say, it has distinct morphology, etc. Also, in high quality typological works, 
we need to read the whole grammar, not just pages devoted to "adjectives".

Just because two languages realize the same function/structure differently doesn't mean no sensible comparison can
be made between them. For example, a language's case affix may be analyzed as postposition, but this doesn't matter:
we can still compare its abstract case system with other languages, regardless of how cases are morphologically 
marked. 

## 6.2

We may do intra-language typology or extra-language typology. The first is about systems within the language, while
the latter is about how things in the real world get represented. If we find something in the real world is 
systematically encoded as a system in the grammar (example: time coded as tense), then an intra-language study 
about that abstract system should be done afterwards. 

When doing intra-language typology, do not compare isolated entities: do not compare the existence of a 
single vowel, whether the language has plural, and so on. Rather, compare the vowel system, the number system, etc.

## 6.3

No key points: worth a thorough reading

- a common five vowel system: i e a o u
- a frequent four vowel system: i e a u (u = u + o)
- a less frequent four vowel system: i a o u (i = i + e)
- a three-vowel system is almost always i a u

Note that sometimes only certain consonants are allowed to appear at certain positions, so terms like CVCV have no
value in this case.

## 6.4

No key points: worth a thorough reading

- The role of morphological operations in marking grammatical relations
- Structure of verbal clauses: verb arguments and argument marking
- Phrase structures, especially NP
- Construction types: imperative, interrogative, etc.
- Dependencies between negation and person system (fewer person distinctions under negation)
