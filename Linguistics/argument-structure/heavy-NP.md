CPs Move Rightward, Not Leftward Benjamin Bruening

Overfelt, J. (2015). Rightward movement: A study in locality.

# Right dislocation

> He<sub>i</sub> is a great writer, that guy named Nim<sub>i</sub>

Ott, D., & De Vries, M. (2016). Right-dislocation as deletion. Natural Language & Linguistic Theory, 34(2), 641-690.

Ott, D., & De Vries, M. (2012). Thinking in the right direction: An ellipsis analysis of right-dislocation. Linguistics in the Netherlands, 29(1), 123-134.

It seems the best approach is a coordination and ellipsis approach.

# Heavy NP shift

Heavy NP shift is frequently used in psycholinguistic research:

Liu, L. (2018). Minimalist parsing of heavy NP shift. In Proceedings of the 32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation.

Konietzko, A., Winkler, S., & Culicover, P. W. (2018). Heavy NP shift does not cause freezing. Canadian Journal of Linguistics/Revue canadienne de linguistique, 63(3), 454-464.

Medeiros, D. J., Mains, P., & McGowan, K. B. (2021). Ceiling Effects on Weight in Heavy NP Shift. Linguistic Inquiry, 52(2), 426-440.

# Right node raising

Also known as delayed right constituent coordination (CGEL 15.4.4).

Current approaches to RNR are all not very convincing:

Larson, B. (2012). A dilemma with accounts of right node raising. Linguistic Inquiry, 43(1), 143-150.

multidominance:

Grosz, P. G. (2015). Movement and agreement in right‐node‐raising constructions. Syntax, 18(1), 1-38.

Several unrelated constructions:
