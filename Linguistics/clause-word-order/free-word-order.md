Capturing free word order in generative syntax
======

# Overview

There are basically two types of "free word order":
- Radical free order: 
  - This can be account for both argument indexation around the verb as core arguments + peripheral arguments interpreted as S, A and O (the **pronominal argument hypothesis**), and an arbitrary linearization of the deep syntactic tree (the **dual structure hypothesis**) (Austin and Bresnan 1996).
  - Note that interpreting the peripheral NPs as S, A and O is consistent with the analysis in, say, English, 
  because we are not talking about the "deep" (i.e. vP) structure of these arguments. Rather, we are talking 
  about the canonical position of these arguments in a somewhat "unmarked" sentence, which of course can be 
  language dependent. S and A in English mean SpecTP, but this fact doesn't mean in other languages it's also the case.
- **Scrambling**. This is the kind of "free word order" found in languages like Japanese and German (Yoshimura 2017). 
  - The notion of "scrambling" is always challenged, partly from many anti-formalists (since they conceive the concept as a tool of "language colonization", trying to use English as the standard and describe other languages as weird variations, etc. - despite the fact that Ken Hale, who discovered first radical non-configurational languages, had close relation with many generative linguistics - see [what Chomsky said about him: Kenneth L. Hale, linguist and activist on behalf of endangered languages, dies](http://news.mit.edu/2001/hale)), partly because this is a catch-all term and there are substantially different types of scrambling
  - Basically there are so-called **VP-external** and **VP-internal** scrambling. The first scrambling can be roughly thought as (multiple, if necessary) topics and focuses, concerning the behavior in the CP layer, while the second is more "localized" (for example, being able to create new binding relations - see McGinnis 2000) and can be thought to be inside the VP-shell (Imamura 2015). Another  A good example of VP-internal scrambling is the fact that in Japanese, the direct object and the indirect object of a bitransitive verb can have arbitrary order, i.e. both S DO IO V and S IO DO V. It seems VP-external scrambling is more about the information structure than the VP-internal scrambling, a main reason of which may be that the VP shell itself doesn't have (at least not much) productive components to code information structure information, while the CP shell contains so many functional projections about the information structure (Imamura 2015).
  - Besides topicalization, some scrambling phenomena can be reduced to clause reordering found in non-scrambling languages, raising the problem whether after such decomposition, the term "scrambling" is still necessary at all (Bailyn 2003).
  - Studies of scrambling also have psycholinguistic implications. For example, Minai et al. 2015 shows that 
   children actually know a lot more about *syntactic* aspects of their languages - what they don't know 
   are often about things external to the grammar.

Free word order languages, or non-configurational languages, are often claimed to lack hierarchial phrase structures in English, though a closer look often reveals some traits of a hidden hierarchial structure (Baker 2001).

# John Frederick Bailyn's account for mysterious properties of scrambling analyzed as movement

The basic idea is that scrambling is an A-bar movement triggered by a scrambling feature, which *cannot* be blocked 
by a wh-feature, so scrambling from a wh-island is possible.

# Imamura 2015's pragmatic research

Imamura 2015 is a good example of combination of corpus-based and Givonian approach to pragmatics and Minimalist and Cartographic approach to the underlying syntactic structure.
