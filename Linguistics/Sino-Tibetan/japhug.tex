\title{Reading notes of A Grammar of Japhug}
\author{Jinyuan Wu}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

The theoretical orientation is already well-documented in my notes about English, Latin and Mandarin Chinese.

\chapter{Grammatical overview}

In this chapter we do a round-by-round survey of Japhug grammar.
We start with a very rough anatomy of the structure of Japhug clauses
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.template}),
followed by a bottom-up examination of grammatical categories and relations in the clause
in the rest of \prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause}.
We then do the same for the noun phrase.
We finally list points to investigate in the lexicon of Japhug.

\section{Clause structure}\label{sec:grammatical.clause}

\subsection{The structure template}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.template}

\paragraph*{Clause combining}
We start our discussion on Japhug grammar 
by first dividing utterances into simple clauses.
Adverbial clauses, like temporal clauses or conditional clauses,
seem to always appear before the main clause \citep[\citechap{25}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Coordination may be marked by coordination linker \form{tɕe} or \form{qʰe} or simple parataxis
\citep[\citesec{25.1.6}]{jacques2021grammar}.
In both adverbial clause subordination and coordination,
clauses involved may share the auxiliary copula if there is any
\citep[\citepage{47}, (40); \citepage{1091}, (10)]{jacques2021grammar}.
It seems changing the subject in the middle is also possible
(\prettyref{box:periphrastic-vp-coordination}).

\paragraph*{The simple clause: the nucleus and information packaging}
\label{sec:grammatical.clause.template.nucleus-identification}
A simple clause, which may or may not be a part 
of aforementioned subordination or coordination constructions,
consists of a nucleus clause and possible information packaging devices.
We can say with confidence that the basic order of Japhug nucleus clauses is SOV:
possible alternations of this order can be explained by information packaging constructions,
including right dislocation for afterthought, disambiguation, or emphasis 
\citep[\citesec{22.1.3}]{jacques2021grammar},
left dislocation for topicalization 
\citep[\citepage{1189}]{jacques2021grammar},
or focalization \citep[\citepage{1190}]{jacques2021grammar}.%
\footnote{
    \citep[\citepage{1190}]{jacques2021grammar} has the OSV order,
    and Jacques mentions that the subject is focalized.
    It is possible that this example is a topic-focus-verb construction.
}
Topicalization in Japhug may result in a chain of nucleus clauses sharing one topic
\citep[\citepage{1190}, (11)]{jacques2021grammar}.

\paragraph*{Positions of adverbials}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.template.adverb}
Temporal expressions indicating the absolute time usually appear before the subject
\citep[\citepage{344}, (167); \citepage{283}, (123)]{jacques2021grammar}.
This probably is because the absolute time sets the stage for the event
and by default is topical,
and their syntactic position is comparable to that of adverbial clauses.%
\footnote{
    The situation is similar to that in English:
    temporal phrases like \form{last year} almost always appear at the margin of a clause.
}

On the other hand, \ac{tame} adverbs
appear after the subject and before the direct object
\citep[\citepages{1200-1201,1210}]{jacques2021grammar}.
It seems that locational phases also reside in roughly the same region
\citep[\citepage{302}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Example (46) in \citet[\citepage{1200}]{jacques2021grammar}
suggests that the aspectual adverb precedes the manner adverb.

In some examples the \emph{object} appears before a \ac{tame} adverb,
but this likely arises from topicalization as a pause can be observed after the object
\citep[\citepage{1210}, (82)]{jacques2021grammar}.

\begin{todobox}{Positions of adverbs}{adverb-position}
    Compare the positions of TAME and locational adverbials.
    
    Also, is it possible to have locational stage-setting adverbials?
\end{todobox}

\paragraph*{Auxiliary verb constructions}
In periphrastic conjugation constructions, 
the copula that carries the main \ac{tame} information 
is put at the final position, 
and the main verb precedes it; 
when there are several main verbs coordinated in a clause, 
only one final copula needs to appear \citep[\citepages{1090-1091}]{jacques2021grammar}.

\begin{todobox}{Periphrastic conjugation and verb phrase coordination}{periphrastic-vp-coordination} 
    Note that the subject seems to be changed in the middle 
    (the problem is the meaning of \form{ɯ-ŋgɯ} \translate{\category{3sg.poss}-inside}
    and the constituents introduced by it: 
    does it mean \translate{as three very beautiful girls}, 
    and therefore is an adjunct, or is it a new subject? 
    Also verb phrase coordination is related to syntactic ergativity -- 
    see the discussion on clause pivot)
    
    If the coordination construction indeed works on the level of clause and not VP
    and therefore allows changing the subject in the middle,
    another question arises:
    sharing TAME markers between two clauses is highly unusual.
    This can't be a purely realizational process
    because of the long-range nature of copula sharing.
    So this has to involve (purely) syntactic coordination,
    and the syntactic position of the TAME copula is then higher than the subject,
    which is unusual.
    Another analysis of the construction is that we are looking at a biclausal construction,
    and the coordination happens to a series of nonfinite clauses,
    But then TAME marking can't be biclausal. 
    
    It seems currently the best option is to analyze this construction as coordination of ``small clauses''
    whose \ac{tame} values are then specified by the end-of-sentence copula.
    Note that this construction seems to be only available for \category{imperfective} verbs,
    which appears frequently in periphrastic conjugation
    and likely only specifies the aspectual value. 
    The tense and evidentiality categories coded on the copula are then higher than the subject.
\end{todobox}

\paragraph*{Clausal structural template}
In summary, a Japhug simple clause is a nucleus clause with possible left- or right-dislocations
and/or temporal expressions expressing the absolute time of the event
(\prettyref{box:adverb-position}),
an the nucleus clause, from left to right,
consists of the subject,
tense and aspect adverbs,
manner and locational phrases,
core arguments, the main verb, and a possible auxiliary copula;
all arguments and adjuncts are not obligatory,
presumably because enough information has been coded in the verb.

\begin{todobox}{Other forms of the nucleus clause}{nucleus-clause-infrequent-types}
    Serial verb constructions and nominal predicates;
    also see fossilized N-V sequences. 
\end{todobox}

\paragraph*{Speech fillers}
One final comment about the clausal template:
in spontaneous speeches, Japhug speakers use several speech fillers and not a central vowel 
to mark pause or earn some time to think about what to say next.
The speech fillers have other functions like pronoun or topic marker
and should be ignored when reading Japhug texts
\citep[\citesec{10.3}]{jacques2021grammar}.

\subsection{The verb}


Verbs can be regularly formed by denominal derivations
\citep[\citechap{20}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Since an independent adjective class is absent, 
the only two kinds of denominal derivations 
are noun-to-adverb derivations and noun-to-verb derivations,
the former being relative marginal \citep[\citepage{1011}]{jacques2021grammar};
thus the term \term{denominal} can be used specifically 
to refer to noun-to-verb derivations.

\subsection{Internal complements} 

\paragraph*{Objecthood}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.internal.object}
The concept \term{object} refers to an internal complement position
that is syntactically more active than other internal complements do.

\begin{infobox}{Objecthood in English}{object-in-english}
    In English, the object always follows the main verb with almost no other constituents
    being able to appear between the two,
    and constituents like manner phrases, relative clauses, etc.
    which have their scopes over the core verb phrase follow the object.
    This seems to indicate that there is some sort of implicit fronting 
    of both the verb and the object,
    leaving a swamp of various constituents behind.
    Therefore the argument after the verb -- not necessarily the most patientive argument --
    is the object.
\end{infobox}

A property that is possessed by at most one internal argument is indexation on the verb,
and this is one object-like property. 
The P argument of monotransitive verbs regularly triggers object-like indexation
\citep[\citesec{8.1.3}, \citepage{543}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Some arguments, even when being the sole internal complement of the clause,
can never trigger indexation, and are known to be \term{semi-objects}
\citep[\citesec{8.1.5}]{jacques2021grammar}.

\citet{jacques2016subjects} proposes to define subjecthood (and also subjecthood)
according to relativization constructions:


\begin{todobox}{vP syntax and TP syntax}{argument-shallow-and-deep}
    vP syntax:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Government and binding
        \item Control
    \end{itemize}
    TP syntax:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Coordination
        \item indexation
        \item Relativization \citep{jacques2016subjects}
    \end{itemize}
\end{todobox}

For what \citet[\citesec{14.4.2}]{jacques2021grammar} analyzes as 
the secundative verbs (the valency class where the recipient is more object-like),
the theme can be extracted in relativization \citep[\citepages{581}]{jacques2021grammar}
and be passivized \citep[\citesec{18.1.4}]{jacques2021grammar}.
but the recipient participates in argument indexation
in the same way as the monotransitive object does.
This split of object properties is also observed in the English \form{give sb. sth.} verb frame.
although in the latter there is no object argument indexation
and the recipient is passivized.
What is interesting is that in the resulting verb,
the subject (which is the theme) does not trigger any indexation affixes.
This may be a case of quirky subject.

\paragraph*{Valency alternation} 
Japhug seems to have a construction comparable to
the ``passive'' construction in Mandarin;
in this pseudo-passive construction,
the deep, animate \category{a} argument does not appear, 
while the inanimate deep \category{p} argument is present, 
and the verb has an inverse marker 
despite semantically the event happens 
from an animate participant to an inanimate participant
and is therefore semantically in the direct configuration
\citep[\citepage{575}]{jacques2021grammar}.
The construction only appears in translation of sentences from Mandarin,
and yet a native speaker didn't consider them to be ungrammatical;
whether the 


\subsection{Syntactic pivot of the core clause, or the subject} 

Among arguments in a clause, we can easily recognize a more or less external one
and the rest ones which are more or less internal:
in argument indexation, 
the most agentive argument plays the ``subject'' role,
while the rest of the arguments compete to play the ``object'' role
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.indexation.causative}),
and by default we can observe that the most agentive argument 
appears at the start of the nucleus clause 
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.template.nucleus-identification}).
These facts however can only show that we can easily define a pivot for the deep argument structure.
This is not equivalent to a pivot of \emph{the whole clause}.

The usual criteria for syntactic ergativity are not viable in Japhug,
as we do not have uncontroversial verb phrase-level coordination \citep{jacques2014clause}.
There are coordination constructions in which the two branches share one auxiliary,
but the branches may have different subjects
(see \prettyref{box:periphrastic-vp-coordination}).
This is likely to be a peculiarity of Japhug,
as \citet[\citepage{549}]{prins2011web} mentions 
coordination of two verb phrases sharing the same subject
in Jiaomuzu, a language close to Japhug.

If we restrict ourselves to Japhug, then subjecthood seems to be 
most clearly defined by relativization
(\citealt{jacques2016subjects};
see \prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.internal.object} for the relation 
between relativization and objecthood).
Relativization happens only after the whole clause is finished
and a pivot position definable by relativization is definitely a clausal pivot
-- hence the \term{subject}.

Additionally, the fact that one argument may be separated from
the verb and other arguments by \ac{tame} adverbs
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.template.adverb})
may also be taken as evidence for subjecthood in Japhug.

\subsection{The direct-inverse system}

As is said above, Japhug shows clear nominative-accusative properties.
We however can also observe a direct-inverse alignment system.

According to \citet{oxford2023tale},
what is known as a direct-inverse device may be 
(a) the change of clausal grammatical function of the arguments,
i.e. ``deep inverse'', in which the patient in a way or another gets some subject-related properties 
and hence ergativity is observed in inverse configurations, or
(b) a ``shallow inverse'' which is mostly about argument indexation, 
for example a requirement that only agreement with a speech act participant 
is morphologically permissible
leading to a direct-inverse system based on the distinction between 1,2 and 3.%
\footnote{
    The deep inverse is also known as ``syntactic'' inverse or ``inverse voice'',
    and the shallow inverse is also known as ``morphological'' inverse, or ``inverse alignment''/
    This terminology however is sometimes misleading.
    For example, if we stipulate that in Italian,
    person clitics are agreement formatives
    and first/second person clitics belong to an agreement system only targeting speech act participants,
    while the third person clitic belongs to another agreement system,
    then the impossibility of co-appearance of a first/second person direct object clitic 
    and a third person indirect object clitic Italian 
    can be argued to be due to locality constraints
    \citep{bianchi2006syntax}.
    The existence of a speech-act only agreement system is comparable to ``morphological inverse'',
    but the phenomena related to this system usually will not be called morphology.

    On the other hand, ``syntactic inverse'' covers both syntactic ergativity and morphological ergativity.
    This confusion is seen in the case of Japhug:
    in the inverse configuration of Japhug we see morphological ergativity,
    but this is deep inverse and therefore ``syntactic inverse'' in \citet{oxford2023tale}.
}
The deep inverse can be optional and in this case it is essentially a voice construction;
the shallow inverse should be obligatory or otherwise verbal agreement is arbitrary.
The two of course can be combined and we get a particularly strong inverse system.

\paragraph*{Inverse argument indexation on the verb}
In the verb morphology part of the Japhug inverse system, 
the subject in the direct configuration
and the object in the inverse configuration 
are indexed on the verb. 
The personal affixes on the verb are only about person and number, 
and tell us nothing about the argument position of the argument 
from which they originate.

\paragraph*{Argument indexation in the indirective construction}
The indirective valency class, which usually has a meaning of

\paragraph*{Argument indexation in the causative construction}
\label{sec:grammatical.clause.indexation.causative}
In causative constructions, the ``object'' that determines verbal agreement
can be the causee or the object.
Which argument is chosen depends on the persons of the arguments.
First, among internal arguments,
if one is first or second person and another is third person,
then the first/second person one is indexed.
Thus both 2\textto 3\textto 1 and 2\textto 1\textto 3 
are equivalent to 2\textto 1 in argument indexation
\citep[\citepage{584}]{jacques2021grammar},
and both 3\textto 3\textto 1 and 3\textto 1\textto 3 
are equivalent to 3\textto 1 in argument indexation
\citep[\citepage{310}]{jacques2021grammar}.
On the other hand, 3\textto 1\textto 2 becomes 3\textto 1,
and 3\textto 2\textto 1 becomes 3\textto 2,
which means if the causee and the object are in a local configuration,
the causee is indexed on the main verb.

We can therefore say that the argument playing the role of object in polypersonal indexation
therefore is always the most salient argument,
either according the standard of speech act participation or according to the standard of agentivity.
Whether this is due to the existence of a synchronic saliency hierarchy
or due to historical evolution
(grammars that encode information the speakers deem important survive) is not clear.

\paragraph*{Deviations from the ideal inverse system}
The ability for an argument to trigger argument indexation
depends on the animacy of the argument.
Inanimate arguments rarely trigger number indexation 
\citep[\citesec{14.6.1.1}]{jacques2021grammar}.

An interesting phenomenon is the theme of secundative verbs
cannot be indexed and it cannot be first or second person.
This again seems to suggest some relation between
the ability to trigger argument indexation and animacy.

\paragraph*{Ergativity in inverse configurations}
In the inverse configuration of Japhug, 
the A argument receives an ergative marker.
This falls into the category of deep inverse said above.
Properties other than the case marking of the A argument are however not changed:
evidence supporting a higher position of the ergative A argument 
include the fact that it can be separated from the object and the verb 
by an intransitive clause \citep[\citepage{306}]{jacques2021grammar}
in which a gap coreferential with the ergative argument exists.
Therefore, in the inverse configuration, we cannot say that
the patient is rendered the syntactic pivot:
we should instead analyze the Japhug inverse system as
inverse-triggered morphological ergativity,
in which the only subject-like property that the A argument gets
is the ergative case.

\begin{todobox}{Syntactic pivot and ergativity}{japhug-ergative}
    List some facts as evidence for morphological ergativity.
\end{todobox}

\subsection{\ac{tame} categories}


Decomposition of \acs{tame} categories 
in the same way English \form{he [is playing] football} 
is analyzed as ``present (imperfect) progressive'' is not necessary
if there is no need for cross-linguistic comparison:
although we are able to distinguish between e.g. the present tense and the past tense,
or the progressive aspectuality v.s. the non-progressive one,
not every combination of attested tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality values in Japhug 
can be morphologically realized.

The morphological realization of these categories is remarkable
Their main exponents are the alternation of the orientation prefix.
Some \acs{tame} categories insert a fixed prefix 
into the orientation prefix slot;
others choose one of the four prefixes that have the same directional meaning 
in \citet[\citetable{15.1}]{jacques2021grammar}. 

\begin{todobox}{Interaction between TAME and orientation}{tame-orientation-morphology}
    Does the TAME marking override the lexically determined orientation prefix 
    or the semantically significant orientation prefix of a orientable prefix?
\end{todobox}

\section{Noun phrase}

\paragraph*{Compounds} 

\begin{todobox}{Compounds: phrasal, or stem-level?}{compound-analysis}
    Japhug seems to have ``real'' compounds and not just
    the nominal attributive construction in English:%
    \footnote{
        As in \form{noun phrase}.
    }
    inalienable nouns, if appearing as the second element in a compound,
    have no possessive marker \citep[\citepage{15}]{jacques2021grammar}. 
    This however can be analyzed as a realizational effect as well:
    we need other proofs to show that the inalienable noun 
    loses its subcategorization in the compounding process
    and therefore appears purely as a stem.
\end{todobox}

\paragraph*{Counting words}

\begin{todobox}{Counted noun constructions: what's the head?}{counted-noun-headness}
    In \citet[\citepage{10}]{jacques2021grammar},
    it is mentioned that counted nouns correspond to classifiers in Chinese grammar.
    An interesting problem is in a counted noun construction in Japhug,
    which element is the head of the NP.
    In English, the head of the \form{one of} construction is likely \form{one},
    because it can undergo modifications:
    \form{this specific one of \dots},
    so the partitive reading is merely semantic.
    If no direct modification is possible to the counted noun,
    maybe the counted noun has already collapsed into a classifier in this usage.
\end{todobox}

\paragraph*{Noun valency class}
Japhug has the distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns.
An inalienable noun has to have a possessor
which is indexed on the noun,
and this possessor can be understood as a core argument of the head noun
\citep[\citepage{116}]{jacques2021grammar}.

\paragraph*{Coordination}
One interesting feature of the Japhug comitative 
is it's also considered when deciding the number of an \acs{np}
\citep[\citepage{332}]{jacques2021grammar};
but it's still not prototypically a conjunction \citep[\citepage{420}]{jacques2021grammar}:
the \acs{np} following the comitative marker 
may be omitted, 
agreeing with the fact 
that the head noun of an \acs{np}
can also be dropped \citep[\citepage{425}]{jacques2021grammar}.
(In English this is only possible for clauses:
in informal writing and speech people may start with a sentence with \form{and},
i.e. a conjunction construction 
without the first branch,
but they never do so to an \acs{np}.)
The \acs{np} after the comitative marker can also be relativized.
Thus the comitative suffix is still recognized as a type of 
modification.

\section{Ideophones}

The category of ideophone occupies mainly manner adverbial positions
\citep[\citesec{10.1.7}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Its main difference with the adverb class 
is its morphology \citep[\citesec{10.1.2}]{jacques2021grammar}
and phonology \citep[\citesec{10.1.5}]{jacques2021grammar}.

\section{Analyzed examples}


The sentence final stative verb \form{ŋu} be.\category{fact} is 
listed as a stative verb in the dictionary
and seems to take the constituents before it 
as a finite complement clause (TODO: or report speech? see the condition on \citepage{1317}),
which is without any explicit complementizer. 
But also see \citepages{1081, }

\chapter{The verb}

Japhug is a heavily inflected language, 
and most grammatical categories in the clause 
have something to do with the verb.
The structure of the verb can be divided into 
the outer prefix chain (\citealt[\citetable{11.1}]{jacques2021grammar}),
the extended stem, 
and the suffix chain (\citealt[\citesec{11.3}]{jacques2021grammar});
the extended stem contains the stem, 
which may undergo stem alternation (\citealt[\citechap{12}]{jacques2021grammar}),
and inner prefixes related to valence alternation
(\citealt[\citesec{11.2.2}]{jacques2021grammar}).

Whether this complex is to be regarded as one \emph{morphological} or \emph{phonological} word 
is discussed in \citesec{11.6}
in the reference above.
Recognition of wordhood, expectedly, is not self-evident;
\citet{prins2011web} provides an analysis of another rGyalrong language, Jiaomuzu, 
and in this thesis the term \term{verb phrase} 
(i.e. verbal complex in this note) is used,
skipping the discussion on what is a word.
In \citet[\citetable{11.3}]{jacques2021grammar}
four domains are defined using various criteria.

Domain A is defined according to both syntactic and morphological reasons.
What's shown in 
\citetable{11.3} contains all formatives that are relevant to verb inflection,
and they have non-adjacent dependencies,
so strong dependencies exist between them:
these formatives are realized in the same batch 
in clause building.
Now syntactically, the formative \form{-ci} in slit +4 
is selected by some modal prefixes in slot -6,
so the two slots belong to the same system;
on the other hand, outside the +4 and -6 slots 
we only have clitics which clearly belong to systems with higher positions
\citep[\citesec{11.6.2}]{jacques2021grammar},
and thus all -- and only -- formatives in \citetable{11.3}
constitute a syntactic word,
with the same \emph{syntactic} status of a verb-plus-auxiliary verbal complex or a
``verb phrase'' in Dixon's definition (i.e. without internal complements). 
Morphologically, no element is able to intervene 
between two slots in the template, 
so we say this batch is realized as a single morphological word 
instead of a verbal complex.

Domain B is about \emph{obligatoriness}:
thus the +4 slot is not included.
Domain C is defined according to prosodic reasons.

\chapter{Verb frames}

In this chapter we summarize basic verb frames in Japhug.
This is done in \citet[\citepage{14}]{jacques2021grammar},
which is mostly about the finite clause without any valency alternation operations.

\chapter{\acs{tame} marking}


\paragraph*{Realizational details}

The \acs{tame} categories in Japhug 
are introduced in \citet[\citechap{21}]{jacques2021grammar}.
Morphologically speaking, there are three systems
\citep[\citepage{516}]{jacques2019egophoric}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \category{primary} system, 
        whose main exponents are stem alternation, the orientation preverb,
        and the modal prefix;
        all of these happens in the template of the verb \citep[\citetable{21.1}]{jacques2021grammar}.
        The grammatical categories marked in this system are listed below.
    \item The \category{secondary} system, 
        which also happens in the inflection pattern of the verb  
        but is about aspectual and modal categories 
        largely orthogonal to the grammatical categories marked by the \category{primary} system 
        \citep[\citesec{21.6}, \citesec{21.7}]{jacques2021grammar}. 
    \item The \category{periphrastic} system, 
        whose surface form is similar to complement clause constructions 
        with the copula \form{ŋu}.
        The copula in periphrastic constructions 
        never takes any argument indexation markers \citep[\citepage{1090}]{jacques2021grammar},
        and if we are to analyze the constructions as complement clause constructions,
        then the literal reading will be something like  
        ``it's the case that an event happens'',
        with all the contents before the copula 
        being a complement clause of the copula.
        In the follows however it can be seen that 
        the \acs{tame} categories on the copula 
        is complementary with the lexical verb,
        and hence the periphrastic constructions are to be analyzed 
        as single-clause constructions.

        In periphrastic constructions 
        the main verb is often in \emph{finite} forms \citep[\citepage{1081}]{jacques2021grammar};
        Japhug periphrastic conjugation thus has 
        a difference with English or Latin periphrastic conjugation,
        where what are used in periphrastic \acs{tame} categories
        are \emph{non-finite} verb forms.
        The reason possibly is because the periphrastic \acs{tame} categories in Japhug
        historically comes from finite complement clause constructions.

        TODO: is there any constraints on the distribution of participle or infinitive?
\end{itemize}
The interaction of the three morphological systems makes Japhug \acs{tame} system extremely complicated;
some periphrastic categories seem to have identical semantics with 
\category{primary} and \category{secondary} \acs{tame} marking devices \citep[\citepage{1092}]{jacques2021grammar};
whether there are hidden nuances is still not clear.

Besides the verbal complex, \acs{tame} categories are also marked by 
sentential adverbs and sentence-final particles 
(\citealt[\citepage{518}]{jacques2019egophoric}; \citealt[\citesec{21.8}]{jacques2021grammar}).

\paragraph*{Interaction with other categories}

\acs{tame} categories interact strongly with 
the lexical aspect of the main verb,
which can be crudely divided into being stative 
and being dynamic (e.g. \citealt[\citesec{21.3.1.2}]{jacques2021grammar}),
the person of the subject, and  TODO: other properties

\paragraph*{Attested categories}

The following subcategories can be recognized in Japhug: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Subjective evaluation: some \acs{tame} categories can be used to express 
    the feeling of the speaker (\citesec{21.3.2.4}) -- but is this a grammatical category?
    \item Evidentiality.
    Japhug has a highly complicated evidentiality system 
    \citep[\citetable{31.4}]{jacques2015sketch}.
    The values of evidentiality attested include 
    the generic, the factual, the sensory, the egophoric, and the inferential.

    A three-fold distinction can be observed with the non-past tense
    (\citealt[\citesec{21.3.4}]{jacques2021grammar}; 
    \citealt[\citepage{517}]{jacques2019egophoric}): 
    the factual or common knowledge (\citesec{21.3.1.2}), 
    the sensory (\citesec{21.3.2.2}),
    and the egophoric.

    Actually there is a fourth, bleached ``generic'' evidentiality value 
    with the non-past tense.
    The generic non-past \acs{tame} configuration 
    with no other non-trivial \acs{tame} marking 
    is known as the \category{imperfective} \citep[\citesec{21.2}]{jacques2021grammar}.
    This however seems to be very infrequent in main clauses
    without periphrastic auxiliaries (\citepage{1087}),
    indicating a strong preference for Japhug 
    to include a non-trivial evidentiality value in non-past sentences.
    
    The inferential evidentiality value appears only with the past tense,
    possibly because of semantic reasons: 
    an event happening now usually doesn't need to be ``inferred'',
    and this rarity means even this category existed historically,
    it has long been eroded.
    With the past tense, 
    we have a dichotomy between the generic evidentiality and the inferential evidentiality.
    It's impossible to morphologically mark the sensory evidentiality
    with the past tense, 
    possibly again because of the infrequency of this configuration.  
    It should however be noted that 
    the sensory can still be combined with the past tense 
    by periphrastically attaching a sensory copula 
    to the \category{aorist} (i.e. \category{past perfective} -- see below) 
    and the \category{past imperfective}
    which have default evidentiality
    (\citealt[\citesec{21.5.1.8}, \citesec{21.5.3.5}]{jacques2021grammar}; 
    \citealt[\citepage{518}]{jacques2019egophoric}). 
    On the other hand, the factual evidentiality and the egophoric evidentiality
    are never seen together with the past tense.

    \item Primary tense. 
    The distinction between the past and the non-past
    can be clearly identified (\citesec{23.3}, \citesec{23.5}),
    partly from the interaction with evidentiality.
    The meaning of future
    is regularly expressed in the \category{factual} category (\citepage{1102}),
    and thus is sometimes recognized as the future tense 
    or ``factual evidentiality in the future tense'' 
    \citep[\citepage{518}]{jacques2019egophoric}.
    This however seems to be the natural extension of the meaning 
    of the present tense 
    (c.f. English \form{the next high tide is around 4 this afternoon}; 
    \citealt[\citepage{131}, {[20]}]{cgel}),
    and in \citet{jacques2021grammar}, 
    the future tense is not recognized as a grammatical tense in Japhug
    \citep[\citepage{1102}, (46)]{jacques2021grammar}.

    \item Modality. 
        In Japhug, once the irrealis situation occurs, 
        it seems other \acs{tame} categories are not available. 
        There are four types of irrealis modalities falling in this domain:
        the \category{irrealis}, the \category{dubitative}, 
        the \category{imperative}, and the \category{prohibitive}
        \citep[\citesec{21.4}]{jacques2021grammar}.

    \item It seems the anterior category
        (the \category{perfect} category in English)
        is absent in Japhug.

    \item Aspect: the imperfective-perfective distinction.
        The non-past categories are always inherently imperfective:
        no perfective aspectuality is seen with non-past tense 
        \citep[\citepage{517}]{jacques2019egophoric},
        again possibly because of semantic reasons,
        since the perfective may be semantically identified with the past.
        The imperative-perfective distinction can only be seen 
        with the past tense \citep[\citetable{21.1}, note that the \category{aorist} is also known as 
        the \category{past perfective}; \citepages{1135, 1143}]{jacques2021grammar}.
    \item Aspects TODO: terminative, continuative, etc. TODO: the position of the inchoative aspect 
        The progressive aspect (\citesec{21.6}; note that \citetable{21.8}: compatibility?) 
\end{itemize}

The composition between these categories is not orthogonal, 
and no independent morphological exponent can be identified for 
each separate \acs{tame} categories mentioned above
(but in periphrastic conjugation, 
distribution of these primitive \acs{tame} categories 
onto the main verb and the auxiliary copula 
can be observed; \citealt[\citepage{1089}, (7)]{jacques2021grammar}).


\paragraph*{Primary categories}

By combining these categories and removing unattested combinations, 
we find the 11 \category{primary} \acs{tame} categories 
listed in \citet[\citepage{21.1}]{jacques2021grammar}.
The realis part is replicated in \prettyref{tbl:realis-tam}.
Note that the \category{aorist} is just the \category{past perfective} in
\citet[\citetable{31.4}]{jacques2015sketch}, 
and indeed \citet[\citepage{1135}]{jacques2021grammar}
makes it clear that the category expresses past perfective events.
It should be noted that the mapping from tense, aspect and evidentiality features 
to concrete \category{primary} categories 
is only unidirectional:
for some categories there are usages that can't be full described by \prettyref{tbl:realis-tam}.
For example, the \category{imperfective} category 
has hortative meanings sometimes \citep[\citesec{21.2.5}]{jacques2021grammar}; 
and the concrete \category{primary} categories also have non-trivial interaction with the lexical aspect of verbs 
\citep[\citesec{21.2.6}, \citesec{21.2.7}]{jacques2021grammar}.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph*{Periphrastic conjugations} 

In a periphrastic construction we have a main verb in one of the non-past forms 
and one copula carrying tense and aspect information.
The most prevalent periphrastic constructions 
are those formed by combining the copula and the \category{imperfective} 
\citep[\citepage{1089}]{jacques2021grammar},
but constructions with \category{factual} \citep[\citesec{21.3.1.4}]{jacques2021grammar}
and \category{sensory} verb forms are also possible. 

\chapter{Clause embedding}

\paragraph*{Manner serial verb construction}

The term \term{serial verb construction} is a cover-all terms for constructions 
where there are two verbs (or at least words that look like verbs) found in a clause 
but the clause is clearly not a complement clause construction or an auxiliary verb construction.
The underlying structure can be extremely heterogeneous:
control construction, coordination on the level of core verb phrase 
(hence the two verbs share the same \ac{tame} marking), 
manner adverbial construction where the modifier is a core verb phrase, 
non-prototypical auxiliary clause construction, and even more.
In Japhug attested serial verb constructions can all be placed under the 
category of manner adverbial construction \citep[\citesec{25.4.1}]{jacques2021grammar}.

In the Japhug serial verb construction,
the modified main verb is the second verb; 
the modifier precedes the main verb and may be one of the follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A deideophonic verb \citep[\citesec{25.4.1.1}]{jacques2021grammar};
    \item A similative verb phrase containing \form{fse} or \form{stu} 
        and their semi-object, 
        with the meaning of \translate{do like this};
    \item A verb phrase describing simultaneous action \citep[\citesec{25.4.1.4}]{jacques2021grammar},
    possibly followed by the emphasis marker \form{zo};
    \item Other verbs of manner. 
\end{itemize}
In all cases, the first verb (or verb phrase) is the modifier; 
discourse linker \form{tɕe} can appear between the modifier and the main verb
\citep[\citepage{1408}, (73)]{jacques2021grammar}, 
demonstrating that the two verbs are two morphological words. 

\paragraph*{Degree serial verb construction} 

Interestingly, a serial verb construction describing the degree of an action 
can also be found in Japhug; 
in this construction the verb describing the degree is the \emph{second} verb.
One way to analyze the historical origin of the construction 
is to treat everything before the stative degree verb as its complement,
and thus \citet[\citepage{1410}, (76)]{jacques2021grammar} 
may be analyzed as \translate{that the elders who knew [traditional stories] well die is finished.}
This however is against the observation that the agreement marker on the second verb 
agrees with the subject (and therefore is plural in the above case, 
not singular as expected for an impersonal verb),
which clearly says that the construction is indeed monoclausal.

Another possible historical origin of the construction 
is verb phrase-level coordination,  
something with the meaning of 
English \form{?The elders who knew traditional stories died and they finished.}
The English example here is awkward, 
partly because \form{die} is a state-change verb in English 
and therefore specifying its progress is semantically unacceptable.
