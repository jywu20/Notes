## Noun

### Case

#### Nominative-Accusative system
- nominative
- accusative
- dative
- genitive

vocative, predicative, exclamative

The concept of transitivity can be generalized in terms of case assignment: a lexical item is transitive if it assigns nominative case to a nominal expression that it c-commands.

#### Ergative-Absolutive

## Types of sentences

### Tag questions
Sometimes we answer a question with another question, or ask a question that can only have one answer. We call it the tag question.

`Mary has gone to Paris, has she?`

We say the sentence is tagged by `has`.

## Clauses

### ECM clause

The subject of an infinite clause as the complement of a verb is in accusative case in English.
However,  in **exceptional case-marking (ECM) clauses**, the subject of the clause seems to really be an object of the main clause. For example:

> *John was wanted <del>for</del> to apologize.
>
> John was requested to apologize.
> 
> John was wanted to join the Army.

ECM clauses are not CPs, because if they are CPs, Impenetrability Condition will block passivization.

### Raising verb

Ses [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_(linguistics))

We have raising-to-subject verbs (They seem to be ...) and raising-to-object verbs. The latter is also known as ECM verbs. (TODO: any differences?)

### Control verb

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(linguistics))

Control verbs are similar to raising verbs in that the subject/object of the main clause is also an argument of the embedded clause. 
The main differences between control and raising include the follows.

> a. *Fred asked there to be a party. - Expletive there cannot appear as the object of a control predicate.
> 
> b. Fred expects there to be a party. - Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate.
> 
> a. *Jim forced there to be a party. - Expletive there cannot appear as the object of a control predicate.
> 
> b. Jim believes there to have been a party. - Expletive there can appear as the object of a raising-to-object predicate.

This also shows that the raised subject is less semantically connected to a raising verb than to a control verb.

Also,

> a. The cat wants to be out of the bag. - There is no possible idiomatic interpretation in the control construction.
> 
> b. The cat seems to be out of the bag. - The idiomatic interpretation is retained in the raising construction.

The explanation for this fact is that raising predicates do not semantically select their arguments, and therefore their arguments are not interpreted compositionally, as the subject or object of the raising predicate. Arguments of the control predicate, on the other hand, have to fulfill their semantic requirements, and interpreted as the argument of the predicate compositionally.

## Ellipsis and Gapping

Ellipsis means to omit a constituent, while gapping means to omit a head.
