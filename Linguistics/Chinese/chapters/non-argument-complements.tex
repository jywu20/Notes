\section{Overview}

\subsection{The name of non-argument complements}

In the School Grammar, 补语 or (non-argument) complement in a clause means anything that is licensed and 
selected by the verb yet does not fill a typical argument slot. In \ac{cgel}, arguments are also called 
as complements, so we emphasize \emph{non-argument} in the title of this chapter. 

The non-argument complements are indeed complements. Consider, for example, the following examples
of quantity complements (see \prettyref{sec:quantity-complement} for more details):
\begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
        \ex 我打了他[一下]。
        \ex 我打了他[一巴掌]。
        \ex 我打了他[一拳]。
        \ex *我打了他[一口]。
        \ex 我咬了他[一下]。
        \ex 我咬了他[一口]。
        \ex *我咬了他[一巴掌]。
        \ex *我咬了他[一拳]。
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
From the facts above we conclude that the verb licenses the quantity complement. Should a quantity
complement appears, its measure word cannot vary arbitrarily. The verb 打 allows 下, 巴掌 or 拳 as 
the measure word of its quantity complement, but it rejects 口. 
On the other hand, the verb 咬 only accepts 下 and 口 and rejects 巴掌 or 拳.
It is ungrammatical to use a complement that is not licensed by the verb, though they may not be 
obligatory. This is just like complements in NPs in English.

Sometimes a complement is not only \emph{licensed}, but also \emph{required}, just like an argument,
but it is by no means nominal, nor is it a clause (which can be thought as nominal in some sense). 
Consider the following examples about location complements (see \prettyref{sec:location-complement}):
\begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
        \ex 我住在北京。
        \ex *我住。
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%TODO: I get up中的up是不是也是类似的？需要查一下CGEL中对verb particle construction的讨论

\subsection{Grammatical properties}

\subsubsection{Constituent order}

Non-argument complements involve highly complicated grammatical phenomena. Sometimes a non-argument 
complement precedes the object, as in the case of result complements (see \prettyref{sec:result-complement}):
\begin{exe}
    \ex 熊_{\text{subject}} 拍_{\text{verb stem}} 晕_{{\text{result complement}}} 了_{\text{perfect aspect}} 他_{\text{object}}。
    \label{eq:order-result-complement}
\end{exe}
But for quantity complements (see \prettyref{sec:quantity-complement}), the inverse order is attested sometimes:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 熊_{\text{subject}} 拍_{\text{verb stem}}  了_{\text{perfect aspect}} 他_{\text{object}} [三巴掌]_{\text{quantity complement}}。
\end{exe}
For a quantity complement with 巴掌 as the classifier, the verb-complement-object order is somehow strange:
\begin{exe}
    \ex ???熊拍了三巴掌我。
\end{exe}
While for a quantity complement with 个 as the classifier, the verb-complement-object order in \eqref{eq:order-result-complement} is more acceptable:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 小朋友拍了几下球。
    \ex ??小朋友拍了球几下。
\end{exe}

One particular interesting property of non-argument complements is that they often trigger double occurrences
of the main verb. All types of non-argument complements show certain degree of this phenomenon:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 你找这本书找到了吗？（～你找到这本书了吗？）
    \ex 他爬山永远爬不上去。（～\%他永远爬不上去山。）
    \ex 我找这本书就是找不到。（～我就是找不到这本书。）
    \ex 我写文章写不出来啊。（～我写不出来文章啊。）
    \ex 我打球打得胳膊酸痛。（*我打球得胳膊酸痛。）
    \ex 我打球打得篮筐坏了。（*我打球得篮筐坏了。）
    \ex 熊打他连续打了三巴掌。（～熊连续打了他三巴掌。）
    \ex 我敲桌子敲了两下。（～我敲了两下桌子。）
\end{exe}
Sometimes there exists a grammatical counterpart of the above examples with the main verb occurring only once, 
sometimes there does not.

\subsubsection{Interplay between non-argument complements and adverbials}

In the following sections, the interplay between non-argument complements and objects is discussed.
It seems at the first glance that pre-verbal adverbials have no non-trivial interaction with complements:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 我_{\text{subject}} 昨天_{\text{time adverbial}} [在那条街上]_{\text{place adverbial}} [狠狠地]_{\text{manner adverbial}} [打了]_{\text{verb, perfect}} 他_{\text{object}} [一顿]_{\text{complement}} % TODO: Aspect
\end{exe}
There are, however, some non-trivial interplay between adverbials and complements. 
\eqref{ex:no-both-adverbial-and-promoted-complement} is a case in which a complement seems to be moved to an
adverbial position. % TODO: more examples

\subsubsection{Limited compositional usage of non-argument complements}

Compositional using of non-argument complements is much more limited. Consider, for example, 
the following sentences:
\begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
        \ex 那头熊拍了他[一巴掌]_{\text{quantity complement}}。
        \ex 那头熊拍[晕]_{\text{result complement}}了他。
        \ex[*]{那头熊拍晕了他一巴掌。}\label{ex:paiyun-yibazhang-illegal}
    \end{xlist}
    \label{ex:paiyunle-yibazhang}
\end{exe}
This shows quantity complements (\prettyref{sec:quantity-complement}) and result complements 
(\prettyref{sec:result-complement}) do not always allow compositional appearing. 

Note that is \emph{is} possible sometimes for a quantity complement and a result complement occur together, 
but some subtleties occur in such constructions -- see, for example, \prettyref{sec:complement-non-verb-dependency}.

For the case of \eqref{ex:paiyunle-yibazhang}, one possible way to make them appear together is via the following construction:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 那头熊[一巴掌]_{\text{quantity complement?}}拍[晕]_{\text{result complement}}了他。
\end{exe}
where the quantity complement is promoted to a pre-verbal position. In this construction no more manner adverbial can appear:
\begin{exe}
    \ex[*]{那头熊[用力地]_{\text{manner adverbial}}[一巴掌]_{\text{promoted quantity complement}}拍晕了他。}
    \label{ex:no-both-adverbial-and-promoted-complement}
\end{exe}
while other adverbials can still appear:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 那头熊[昨天]_{\text{time adverbial}} [在那座山下面的小树林里]_{\text{place adverbial}} 一巴掌拍晕了他。
\end{exe}
So it seems the fronted quantity complement is in complementary distribution with the ordinary manner adverbial.
Note that the quantity complement cannot be promoted to the pre-verbal position if it is the only non-argument 
complement:
\begin{exe}
    \ex[*]{那头熊一巴掌拍了他。}
\end{exe}

Some compositional using is indeed possible. Below is the example of a direction complement 
(\prettyref{sec:direction-complement}) and a quantity complement (\prettyref{sec:quantity-complement})
appearing together:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 那头熊打[中]_{\text{direction complement}} 了 他 [两次]_{\text{quantity complement}}。
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Indirect dependency between complements}\label{sec:complement-non-verb-dependency}

A slightly adjusted version of \eqref{ex:paiyunle-yibazhang} is shown here:
\begin{exe}
    \ex 那头熊拍晕了他三次。
    \label{ex:paiyun-yixia}
\end{exe}
Now compositional usage of a quantity complement and a result complement is possible\dots Or is it?
If investigated more closely, the meaning of \eqref{ex:paiyun-yixia} is \emph{not} the composition 
of 那头熊拍晕了他 and 那头熊拍了他三次. \eqref{ex:paiyun-yixia} means ``the bear squatted him into
coma, and he fell into coma for three times'', while in the clause 那头熊拍了他三次, what happens 
three times is the bear's squat, not any other events. So we find when a quantity complement 
and a result complement occur together, there is dependency relation between the two complements, 
\emph{not} the quantity complement and the main verb. In other words, in \eqref{ex:paiyun-yixia}
the quantity complement is an \emph{indirect} dependent (in the sense of \ac{cgel}, sec. 5.14.1). 
It is licensed by the result complement, not the main verb. This explains why \eqref{ex:paiyun-yibazhang-illegal}
is ungrammatical: because 一巴掌 is a grammatical complement of 拍, but not a grammatical complement of 晕.

\subsubsection{Non-canonical subject}

Complements are even related to the role of subject. Consider the following examples:
\begin{exe}
    \ex Result complement
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex 这个电影真是笑死我了。
        \ex 这个电影真是把我笑死了。
        \ex \%我被这个电影笑死了。 % TODO
    \end{xlist}
    \ex Manner and consequence complement 
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex 这条山路走得我累得不行。
        \ex \%这条山路把我走的累得不行。 % TODO
        \ex ??我被这条山路走得累得不行。
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In all these examples, the subject is not filled by the agent -- or is there an agent at all in the main clause?
But the clauses are all active ones. 

\subsubsection{Complement and negation}

\subsection{Classification of non-argument complements}\label{sec:complement-classification}

Here I summarize basic types of non-argument complements. The prototypical semantic functions of 
non-argument complements other than quantity complements are shown in \prettyref{tbl:complement-class}.
Sections from \prettyref{sec:direction-complement} to \prettyref{sec:location-complement} discuss in 
detail the inner structure, external syntactic functions and mutual interactions of these 
complements. Since complements in \prettyref{tbl:complement-class} have complementary distribution,
one way to classify nucleus predicates according to the complements they contain. 

The status of quantity complements (\prettyref{sec:quantity-complement}) is kind of controversial.
Since quantity complements look like nominal arguments and can occur together with other types of 
complements, just like objects do, some authors kick it from the family of complements and 
assign various names to it, mostly quasi-object and time expression. I will discuss these aspects 
at the beginning of \prettyref{sec:quantity-complement}.

\section{Manner and consequence complements}\label{sec:manner-consequence-complement}

Manner complements are also called degree complements 程度补语 for obvious reasons.
Consequence complements are also called state complements 状态补语, since they describe the state of 
objects undergoing the action in question \citep[sec. 5.8.4]{xianhan2004}.

\subsubsection{Manner and consequence complements and pseudo-attributive constructions}

\begin{exe}
    \ex Pseudo-attributive constructions 
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex 他的老师当得好。
        \ex 他的工作做得细致。
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\citep{huang2008}

\section{Time and location complements}\label{sec:location-complement}

Time and location complements are often called as \emph{prepositional complements}, because they are 
realized as prepositional phrases (see \prettyref{chap:coverbs}). 
These complements illustrate where and when the action they modify happens.
Here are some examples of time and location complements:
\begin{exe}
    \ex Location of action \begin{xlist}
        \ex \gll 他   住   [ 在_{\text{preposition}} 北京 ]_{\text{location complement}}。 \\
                 3sg  live {} at                           Beijing \\
            \glt `He lives in Beijing.' 
        \ex \gll 我  蹲     [ 在_{\text{preposition}}  [ 厕所 里 ]_{\text{location phrase}} ]_{\text{location complement}}。 \\
            1sg squat  {} at {} toilet inside \\
            \glt `I squat in the toilet.'
    \end{xlist}

    \ex Time of action \begin{xlist} % TODO: time phrase??
        \ex \gll 鲁迅 生 [ 于_{\text{preposition}} 1881年_{\text{time phrase}} ]_{\text{time complement}}。\\
               Lu.Xun be.born {} at 1881 \\
            \glt `Lu Xun was born in 1881.'
        \ex \gll 我 等 他 一直 等 [ 到_{\text{preposition}} 昨天_{\text{time phrase}} ]_{\text{time complement}}。 \\
                 1sg wait 3sg continuously wait {} towards yesterday \\
            \glt `I waited for him until yesterday.'
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Since the distinction between Chinese prepositions and verbs is somehow vague, with lots of prepositions
being better named as coverbs (\prettyref{chap:coverbs}), location complements are sometimes hard to be 
separated from serial verb constructions. Consider the following example:
\begin{exe}
    \ex Destination of object 
    \gll 我 交 了 一 本 书 [ 给_{\text{coverb}} 他 ]_{\text{???}}。\\
                 1sg hand.over PERF one CLF.book.like book {} give 3sg \\
            \glt `I give him a book.'
\end{exe}
The bracketed words give information about towards which place the object 书 moves. Should we analyze it 
as a marginal location complement? % TODO: 和serial verb construction建立联系，并且讨论两者的区别
% TODO：这个构造又和“我把笔芯装进笔杆里了”不同，其中“我装笔芯进笔杆里”读不通

\section{Quantity complements}\label{sec:quantity-complement}

The \concept{quantity complement}, also considered as a subset of time expressions (and not listed in complements)
by some authors \citep[sec. 7.2-7.4]{po2015chinese} or as quasi-objects by others \citep[sec. 5.7]{xianhan2004}, is usually filled by a % TODO: “一个”这样的短语应该叫做什么；这里有加括号悖论，就是“一个理论”可以分解成“一个”+“理论”
