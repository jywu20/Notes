\section{What language? What grammar?}

This proto-book is about aspects of the grammar of the contemporary Chinese language (现代汉语). 
Each word in this phrase can trigger controversy. Before we start substantial discussion, it is a wise idea 
to clarify what we are actually talking about. 

\subsection{Standard Mandarin and its variation}

% 新文化运动时期的作品读着不顺口

In the rest of the proto-book, we use the term \emph{Chinese} 中文，（现代）汉语，华语 interchangeably with 
the more precise term \emph{Standard Mandarin Chinese}.

\subsection{The possibility to have a structure-based grammar}

The structure-based approach is by no means a rejection of functionalist studies. Rather, the former explores 
what features can be employed by the latter.

\section{The descriptive framework}

It is impossible to sit there and just ``observe the world without bias''. People always do observation within a 
framework. Some may argue that typologists

\subsubsection{Dependency relations and phrase structures}

\subsubsection{The notion of \emph{head}}

\subsubsection{Empty categories and fusion-head constructions}

\subsubsection{Summary}

After length discussions, it is time to go back and summarize the framework we adopt in this proto-book.

\subsubsection{Categories and the notion of ``word''}

A \concept{category}\index{category} is defined as a type of constructions with similar distributions.
We will first discuss basic syntactic constructions and identify positions that can be filled in them, 
and then search possible constructions in these positions. This is how categories can be recognized.

A construction that is small enough is said to be a \concept{word} or more precisely, 
a \concept{grammatical word}\index{word!grammatical}.
We emphasize \emph{grammatical} because it is quite common to use the term \emph{word} 词 to denote 
a \concept{prosody word}\index{word!prosody}. Prosody is important in Chinese, % TODO to a chapter about prosody

In traditional grammars concerning Latin, a common practice is to roughly define word classes (nouns, verbs, etc.) 
according to their meaning and then discuss where they can be used. 
In this proto-book we do not take this approach. Though we will review a lot of work based on the meaning-first 
approach, the way we distinguish word classes is mainly distributional. If two words can appear in similar
positions, they are classified into one \concept{word class}\index{word class} or \concept{part of speech}.
A word class is just a category about words.  

In other words, we define concepts like \emph{noun-like} and \emph{verb-like} \emph{before} listing criteria of 
what is a noun and what is a verb. Criteria for word classes are always language-specific, but we have more 
confidence that at least some \emph{features} -- like the nominal feature \textit{n} or the verbal feature 
\textit{v} are in universal grammar.
