Many mechanisms are proposed to derive this construction.
One analysis is that V_1 and NP do not form a constituent. % TODO: why this approach is problematic
Another analysis is that there is a copy of NP which serves as the object of V_1,
while another copy of NP serves as the subject of V2,
and only one of them is spelt out.
Yet a third analysis involves sideward movement:
first [VP V_2 \dots] is built,
and then the NP is moved out to be Merged with V_1,
and then the two VPs are inserted into the clause structure.
Since these analyses all result in similar % TODO: 他们真的无法辨别吗？？？
