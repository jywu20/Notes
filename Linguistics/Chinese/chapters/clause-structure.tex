This chapter gives a sketch of the inner structure of clauses.
Most of the time it is about simple clauses\index{clause!simple} and leave subordination to 
\prettyref{chap:relative} and \prettyref{chap:comp-clause}.
This being said, matrix clauses\index{clause!matrix} (the surrounding environment of subordinated clauses)
will also appear briefly in this part, so what we are talking about in this chapter -- and this part -- is 
actually the $v$P layer and the TP layer, but not the CP layer, so topicalization etc. are not 
discussed in this part. 

We can further break the $v$P layer -- in more descriptive terms, the argument 
structure\index{argument structure}, associated motions, etc.
-- from the TP layer -- in more generative terms, marking of the manner, time, etc. of an event and the
obligatory topic. There are descriptive works organizing chapters about clause structure in this way, for example \citet{jacques2021grammar} for Japhug, in which chap.~14 and 15 discuss the argument structure and associated motions (unmarked $v$P properties), 
and chap.~17-19 discuss valency changing devices (valency changing $v$Ps), and chap.~21-22 discuss TP properties of simple clauses. 
% TODO: 其实我还没决定要怎么写，是先介绍典型句子再transform还是vP和TP严格分开写

the argument structure is already much simplified compared to older forms of Chinese.

\section{Constituent order and segmentation}

The structure and constituent order of a clause is roughly the follows:
\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:clause-order} subject $>$ adverbials $>$ main verb $>$ suffixes $>$ indirect object $>$ direct object $>$ quantity complement $>$ sentence final particles
\end{exe}
The concept of \emph{coverbs} is discussed in \prettyref{chap:coverbs}.

The School Grammar segments these constituents in a way quite similar to the \ac{cgel} approach. 
Take the analysis in \citet[chap. 5]{xianhan2004} as an example.
A clause is first divided into 主语 (subject) and 谓语, and 谓语 is then divided into 述语, 宾语 (object) and 补语,
and 谓语 has modifiers named 状语, while modifiers in NPs are named as 定语. We can almost identify 
谓语 as \emph{predicate}\index{predicate} in \ac{cgel}, and 述语 as \emph{predicator}\index{predicator}. 
The term for 状语 in \ac{cgel} is certainly \emph{adjunct}, but to avoid confusion we use \emph{adverbial}
here, in accordance with most works in Chinese grammar. 
The sentence final particles are often called as 语气词 % TODO: “语气词”的英文翻译
% TODO: 关于语气词位置较高的argumentation

The School Grammar analysis of clause structure can therefore be summarized as the follows:
\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:school-grammar-clause} \concept{The School Grammar analysis of clause structure}
    \input{trees/clause-structure-school-grammar.tex}
\end{exe}
This is also the starting point of this proto-book's discussion of clause structure. 

\eqref{ex:school-grammar-clause} is more about syntactic functions than the inner structure of constituents.

\section{The nucleus predicate}

The constituent (or order) in the nucleus predicate is the follows:

\section{Negation}

There is no negative concord in Chinese, but there is no uniform negation operator like the English 
\emph{not} in Chinese, neither. 

\begin{exe}
    \ex \begin{xlist}
        \ex 我做 [不了]_{\text{potential complement, negative}} 这件事。
        \ex[*]{我\{没有/并非/不\}_{\text{negative operator}} 做 [得了]_{\text{potential complement, positive}} 这件事。}
    \end{xlist}    
\end{exe}
