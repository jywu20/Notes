This chapter gives a sketch of the inner structure of clauses.
Most of the time it is about simple clauses\index{clause!simple} and leave subordination to \prettyref{chap:relative} and \prettyref{chap:comp-clause}.
This being said, matrix clauses\index{clause!matrix} (the surrounding environment of subordinated clauses)
will also appear briefly in this part, so what we are talking about in this chapter -- and this part -- is 
actually the $v$P layer and the TP layer, but not the CP layer, so topicalization etc. are not 
discussed in this part. It is of course possible 
to further break the $v$P layer -- or in more descriptive terms, the argument structure\index{argument structure} 
-- from the TP layer, but this is not how things are done in more descriptive works, and in modern Chinese 
the argument structure is already much simplified compared to older forms of Chinese.

The constituent order of a clause is basically the follows:

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:clause-order} subject $>$ adverbials $>$ coverbs $>$ adverbials $>$ main verb $>$ suffixes $>$ indirect object $>$ direct object $>$ sentence final particles
\end{exe}

The School Grammar segments these constituents in a way quite similar to the \ac{cgel} approach. 
Take the analysis in \citet[chap. 5]{xianhan2004} as an example.
A clause is first divided into 主语 (subject) and 谓语, and 谓语 is then divided into 述语, 宾语 (object) and 补语,
and 谓语 has modifiers named 状语, while modifiers in NPs are named as 定语. We can almost identify 
谓语 as \emph{predicate}\index{predicate} in \ac{cgel}, and 述语 as \emph{predicator}\index{predicator}.
