\chapter{Grammatical overview}

\section{Morphological typology}

Mandarin lacks prototypical inflectional morphology but has rich derivational morphology.
Compounding is the most frequent morphological device,
and partly due to influences of European languages, partly due to grammaticalization,
affixation is also frequently seen.
Plus, reduplication plays an important role in Mandarin verbal and adjectival derivation.

One caveat about talking about derivational morphology is that it assumes
the existence of a well-defined wordhood.
It's often claimed that Mandarin lacks the word/phrase distinction.
In this note, we will show that wordhood can indeed be clearly defined 
by syntactic, morphological and phonological standards.
What makes Mandarin unique is that the three definitions of wordhood do not always overlap.

\begin{todobox}{Different standards of woodhood}{wordhood}
    Define
\end{todobox}

Because of this, Chinese lexicography is usually based on \emph{morphemes},

\section{Clauses}

\subsection{Clauses are made of nucleus clauses and high-level categories}

A clause can be divided into several clauses 
linked by \concept{clause linking} constructions,%
\footnote{
    \citet{cgel} uses the term \term{sentence} 
    to refer to a natural unit in dialogue,
    which I refer to as a \term{utterance}.
    The term \term{sentence} here refers to 
    a clause that qualifies as an utterance. 

    Some people, like \citet[\citepage{140}]{deng2010formal}
    as well as \citet{dixon2009basic},
    use the term \term{clause} for subject-predict constructions 
    with no speech force marking.
    (\citet{deng2010formal} uses 句子 as the Mandarin counterpart of \term{sentence}
    and 小句 as the counterpart of \term{clause}.)
    In this way, \acl{sfp}s strictly shouldn't be
    regarded as a part of the clause, 
    and they may be discussed together with 
    other higher level constructions like clause linking. 
    This notion of clause correctly highlights the hierarchy in clausal structures.
    The problem with this terminology however is that in traditional grammars,
    the term \term{clause} does refer to units that have \ac{sfp}s.
    
    This note therefore refers to all units larger than the 
    subject-predicate construction as clauses, 
    which may or may not be sentence.
    The subject-predicate construction is instead named the \emph{nucleus} clause.
    The internal complexity of a clause 
    is still relevant for example in clause combining.
}
including \concept{coordination} and \concept{subordination}.
Mandarin has ample information marking phenomena,
and thus a clause can be divided into
one or more \concept{topics}, if any, and a \concept{comment},
the latter being the \concept{nucleus clause}
plus possible \concept{sentence final particles} (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.high-level.topic.1}). 
Note that topicalization and clause linking can happen successively
(\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.high-level.topic-and-coordination.1}),
and coordination can also happen inside the nucleus clause
(TODO: ref).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.high-level.topic.1}
    \gll {} [张三]_{\text{topic},i}， [[他]_{\text{subject},i} 就 是 [个 王八蛋]_{\text{copular complement}}]_{\text{nucleus clause}} 罢了！ \\
    {} \category{name} 3 just be \category{cls} turtle-egg \category{sfp} \\
    \translate{Zhang San is a son of a bitch!}

    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.high-level.topic-and-coordination.1}
    \gll{} [我]_{\text{topic},i} [幸亏 ---_i 昨天 没 来]_{\text{nucleus clause}}， [否则 ---_i 就 被 困 住 了]_{\text{nucleus clause}} \\
    {} 2 fortunately {} yesterday \category{neg} come otherwise {} then \category{bei} trap \category{v2} \category{asp} \\
    \translate{Fortunately, I didn't come yesterday, or otherwise I would have been trapped.}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Subject and predicate}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.subject}

The nucleus clause contains a subject (if any) and what is often known as a predicate,%
\footnote{
    \citet{dixon2009basic} argues against the definition of \term{predicate} 
    as the main verb (or adjective) plus somehow ``internal'' arguments.
    He uses the term \term{predicate} to refer to the verbal complex instead.
    However, since I will need to compare the topic-comment construction 
    with the inner structure of the nucleus clause,
    the term \term{predicate} will still be used in the way \citet{dixon2009basic} dislikes,
    because it's the counterpart of the comment role in the topic-comment construction.
}
which usually is a (extended) verb phrase but may also be a nominal. 
In the Mandarin simple nucleus clause,
the definition of the subject, as opposed to the topic,
is not trivially clear.
Here we note that the nucleus clause has a neutral structure (\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.subject.topic}),
in which a subject appearing at the initial is both the argument structure pivot
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.subject.argument})
and the clause-level pivot.

\subsubsection{The neutral order}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.subject.topic}

The notion that in Mandarin, subject is the same as topic is prevalent.
Taking one step further, one may argue that Mandarin has no argument structure at all
and the word order in a clause is shaped by only information structure \citep{lapolla20091}.
This grammar rejects this analysis.

First, we note that a information structure neutral order can be defined for most, if not all, clauses.
An example is provided in (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic}).
The two arguments, 饭 and 吃, can be reordered in a seemingly free way depending on their topicality,
violating the common generalization that Mandarin has a SVO order.
We however note that (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.4})
is completely unacceptable with the intended meaning.
Playing with more possible orders, and we will find that the arguments seem to be
only permitted to move \emph{leftwards} (and thus \ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.4} is not possible),
consistent with the assumption that a neutral ordered nucleus clause is formed first,
followed by topicalization.
By analyzing subtle pragmatics differences, we find (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.1}) seems to be the ``neutral'' order 
(although it imposes weak topicality to 你 \translate{you},
and 吃饭 \translate{eat (lit. eat meal)} is focalized).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic} 
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.1}
        \gll 你 吃 饭 了 吗 \\
        2 eat meal \category{sfp} \category{sfp} \\
        \glt\translate{Have you eaten?} 
        \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.2}
        \gll 饭 你 吃 了 吗 \\
        meal 2 eat \category{sfp} \category{sfp} \\
        \glt\translate{Have you eaten?}
        \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.3}
        \gll 你 饭 吃 了 吗 \\
        2 meal eat \category{sfp} \category{sfp} \\
        \glt\translate{Have you eaten?}
        \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.4}
        \gll *饭 吃 你 了 吗  \\
        meal eat 2 \category{sfp} \category{sfp} \\
        \glt\translate{Intended meaning: have you eaten? (Actual meaning: has meal eaten you?)}
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

We also note that there is no dangling topic in Mandarin (\prettyref{sec:topic-subject}).
This means \emph{all} topics originate from somewhere within the nucleus clause.
On the other hand, the subject, if well-defined by the usual pivot tests, is a part of the nucleus clause,
and therefore in Mandarin, topic and subject are different.

\subsubsection{Subject as pivot of argument structure}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.subject.argument}

Being the initial constituent%
\footnote{
    Note that it is possible that certain constituents, like temporal constituents,
    naturally appear before the subject.
}
in clauses like (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.no-topic.1}) 
has a clear relation to being the most prominent or the most \emph{external} argument
-- the agent or causer or the patient in passive constructions.
Examples like (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.valency.1}) can be explained by valency alternation.

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.subject.valency.1} 茶泡好了
\end{exe}

\subsection{The predicate}

(\ref{ex:vp.ex.1}) is an illustration of a complicated nucleus clause.
Its constituent structure is shown in \prettyref{fig:vp.ex.1},
following the notation in \citet{cgel}.
We need to warn that the main information contained in \prettyref{fig:vp.ex.1} 
is the \emph{scopes} of constituents surrounding the core verb phrase,
while the function labels (e.g. \term{head}) and the form labels (e.g. \form{extended VP})
in \prettyref{fig:vp.ex.1} may be misleading,
as 能在我的办公室跟你讨论一下 and 可能能在我的办公室跟你讨论一下
are both labeled as extended VPs, but clearly they have slightly different syntactic statuses:
the auxiliary 可能 can be attached to the former
but it can never appear twice and hence cannot be attached to the latter.


\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{ex:vp.ex.1}
    \gll 我 [明天 可能 能 在 我 的 办公室 跟 你 [讨论 一下]_{\text{core\acs{vp}}}]_{\text{extended \acs{vp}}} \\
    1 tomorrow \category{aux}:possible \category{aux}:ability at my \category{poss} 
    office with 2 discuss a.little.bit \\ 
    \glt \translate{Tomorrow possiblity I can have a discussion with you in my office.}
\end{exe}

\begin{figure}[H]
    {
        \small 
        \input{trees/vp-example-1.tex}
    }
    \caption{Tree diagram of (\ref{ex:vp.ex.1})}
    \label{fig:vp.ex.1}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that when we have verbal prediction,
the full, extended \acs{vp} following the subject 
can be divided into an extension region and the core \acs{vp}
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.core-vp}).
The extension region contains 
\acs{tame} auxiliaries and adverbs not realized in the verbal complex (\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.tam}),
and peripheral arguments like temporal and spatial locations (\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.peripheral}).
Sometimes the object may be fronted and 
it's also possible that a prepositional complement is fronted to this region.

It should be noted that in the disposal and passive constructions,
the manner phrase may appear \emph{after} the auxiliary (\ref{ex:vp.ex.2}),
and in this case the boundary of the core \acs{vp}
can't be clearly defined at the surface level,
which shouldn't be surprising as we do not expect to
always see a clear-cut argument/adjunct distinction.

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:vp.ex.2}
    \gll 我 明天 可能 能 在 我 的 办公室 跟 你 [把]_{\text{auxiliary}}  这 个 问题 [好好]_{\text{manner}} 讨论 一下 \\
    1 tomorrow \category{aux}:possible \category{aux}:ability 
    at my \category{poss} office 
    with 2 
    \category{ba} this \category{cls} problem good
    discuss a.little.bit \\
    \glt \translate{Tomorrow possiblity I can have a good discussion of this problem with you in my office.}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Tense, aspect and modality marking}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.tam}

In (\ref{ex:vp.ex.1}), it can be clearly seen that Mandarin has modal auxiliaries:
the order of 可能 and 能 is strictly 可能 \textgt{} 能 and never the inverse,
suggesting that these modality markers are grammaticalized items.
More analytic markers of \ac{tame} categories can be found:
it seems 据说 is a peripheristic marker of evidentiality, for instance:
in (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.tam.1}),
the order of the \acs{tame} markers is always 据说 \textgt{} 可能, and not the inverse,
suggesting that 据说 is a part of the \acs{tame} grammatical hierarchy.%
\footnote{
    Note that English adverbs like \form{allegedly} follow the same generalization:
    we have e.g. \form{he allegedly possibly did this} but never \form{he possibly allegedly did this}. See \citet{cinque1999adverbs}.
}

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.tam.1} \gll 
    [这 辆 车]_{\text{subject:NP}} [据说]_{\text{evidentiality}} [可能]_{\text{modality}} 不 太 靠谱 \\
    this \category{cls} car is.said \category{aux} \category{neg} very reliable \\
    \glt\translate{It is said that this car may not be very reliable.}
\end{exe}

Mandarin also has (semi-)inflectional marking of aspect by 了, 着 and 过 in the verbal complex
(\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.core-vp}).

Whether Mandarin has something comparable to tense in more prototypical tensed languages is not clear.
An observation is that Mandarin speakers often do not fully subconsciously acquire the tense category when learning tensed languages like English.
This, however, does not fully exclude the possibility of an impoverished tense system.
TODO: ref

\subsubsection{Peripheral arguments}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.peripheral}

The term \term{peripheral argument} is from \citet{dixon2009basic}.
We intentionally use the term here instead of the more frequent \term{adjunct},
because there are both \acs{tame} adjuncts and circumstantial adjuncts,
the latter known as peripheral arguments in \citet{dixon2009basic}.

A clear distinction between core and peripheral arguments,
more often known as the argument/adjunct distinction, is not always possible.
Some criteria used for the distinction are about structural closeness of the argument to the main verb, or in other words scope:
the manner expression usually has scope over the core verb phrase,
and thus the former is classified as a peripheral argument.
Other criteria are based on licensing: intransitive use of a transitive verb is prohibited by the lexicon,
or, in more technical terms, the verb root appearing in a verbal environment but without transitivity is not allowed by the lexicon \citep{siddiqi2009syntax}.
Thus \form{well} in \form{he treats us well} seems to be an argument, although it's a manner expression.
Yet other criteria are based on argument indexation and flagging:
an argument with oblique case marking does not leave agreement markers on the main verb,
while an argument with structural case (nominative, accusative) does
if the language has agreement marking,
and the latter is recognized as a core argument.
Following this standard, many so-called oblique arguments,
like \form{this} in \form{I think [of this]}, would be classified as peripheral,
although they are clearly licensed by the lexical entry of the verb.
These criteria correlate with each other but in a non-deterministic way.

Because Mandarin has no verb agreement, only the first two criteria can be used,
and the problems listed above all occur.
The status of comitative 跟你 in (\ref{ex:vp.ex.1}) is not so clear, for instance:
it is fairly low in \prettyref{fig:vp.ex.1}, but it is not obligatory.
We also note that reordering of peripheral arguments is possible,
but mixing them with \acs{tame} markers sounds problematic to say the least
(\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.peripheral.order.1}).
Note that fronting of the comitative to a higher position is possible (\prettyref{sec:topic.subject}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.peripheral.order.1} \begin{xlist}
        \ex 我明天可能能在我的办公室跟你讨论一下 (=\ref{ex:vp.ex.1})
        \ex 我明天可能能跟你在我的办公室讨论一下
        \ex ??我明天可能跟你能在我的办公室讨论一下
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{The structure of the core verb phrase}\label{sec:grammatical.clause.core-vp}

In the surface form, the core \acs{vp} contains the core arguments and the \concept{verbal complex}.
The verbal complex involves aspectual marking (\prettyref{sec:grammatical.clause.tam}), 
verb derivation and verbal complements (see below);
lexical aspect is not grammatically marked but is important.

\begin{exe}
    \ex\gll 我 [做 完 了]_{\text{verbal complex}} 作业 \\
    1 do finish \category{asp} homework \\
    \glt\translate{I have finished the homework.}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{The verbal complex}

The verbal complex contains three 

Mandarin has lots of clausal complements that are not prototypically arguments, 
known as 补语 in Chinese linguistic community.%
\footnote{
    The term 补语 literally means \translate{complementation speech}, 
    and is therefore often translated as \term{complement}.
    In this note I use the term \term{complement}
    to refer to grammatical constituents that are somehow more closely 
    related to the lexical head, 
    and I choose the (somehow tedious but explicit) term 
    \term{non-argument complement}.
}
This is a rather heterogeneous category,
its boundary (expectedly) being somewhat unclear;
it includes verbal complements or in other words complex predicates, 
complement clauses, 
and oblique arguments. 

\subsubsection{Verb-final constructions}

Mandarin has two types of constructions in which the main verb appears at the final:
the \category{disposal} construction, and the so-called \category{passive} construction,
also known as the \form{ba}-construction and the \form{bei}-construction.

\subsubsection{Transitivity}

Verb frames in Mandarin can be divided into the \category{do} class (about actions),
the \category{become} class (about changes of states),
the \category{cause}-\category{become} class (about something causing a state to change),
and the purely stative \category{be} class.

Just like the case in English, \category{do} verb frames often allow S/A-ambivalence,
where the P argument of a transitive verb frame (i.e. the more internal, patient-like argument) can be removed, leaving only the subject (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.do}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.do} \begin{xlist}
        \ex 他喜欢玩
        \ex 他喜欢玩玩具
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

On the other hand, we observe regular alternations between \category{become} and \category{cause}-\category{become} verbs,
and hence S/P-ambivalence (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.become}).
It should be noted that not all \category{become} verbs can receive a \category{cause}-\category{become} verb frame (\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.become-only}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.become} \begin{xlist}
        \ex 茶泡好了
        \ex 我泡好茶了
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.become-only}
    \begin{xlist}
        \ex 这只猫死了
        \ex *坏人死了这只猫
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The verb frames naturally have correlations with the lexical aspect of the clause:
change-of-state clauses are naturally telic and often cannot be in the progressive aspect
(\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.progressive.1}).
But counterexamples exist
(\ref{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.progressive.2}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.progressive.1} *这只猫正在死
    \ex\label{ex:grammatical.clause.core-vp.valency.progressive.2} 我正在泡茶
\end{exe}

Just try. Fuck git.

\subsubsection{Verb-particle constructions}

Just like English, Mandarin has directional and resultative particles in the argument structure.


\section{Parts of speech}

After a survey of the grammatical system of Mandarin Chinese,
we examine what the lexicon has to feed into the grammar.

\section{Subject being topicalized}\label{sec:topic.subject}

\begin{exe}
    \ex 我明天跟你可能能在我的办公室讨论一下
\end{exe}

\section{(Absence of) dangling topics}\label{sec:topic-subject}

Some people, like \citet[\citesec{7.1}]{zhudexigrammar},
equate \term{subject} with \term{topic} in Mandarin grammar.
Some (especially those from the functional-typological tradition) go further 
and assert that ``the notion of the subject (as the position of the most agentive argument) 
isn't grammaticalized in Mandarin Chinese'',
and therefore the topic-comment construction 
is construed as simply the syntactic coding of aboutness,
and this base-generated and syntactically unconstrained topic 
is called a ``dangling topic''.
This view is rejected in this note,
because such accounts usually end up in severe overgeneration. 
Here I briefly summarize \citet{sih2000topic}'s argumentation.

\subsection{Type 1: Idiomatic phrasal predicate looking like a comment}\label{sec:clause.dangling-topic.1}

In the first type of ``dangling topic'',
it's impossible for any \acs{np} in the comment to be syntactically related to the topic
(\ref{ex:dayuchixiaoyu}, \ref{ex:nikankanwo}).
Such cases however should be analyzed as instances of the
subject-predicate construction,
where the predicate is a dephrasalized clause.

We notice that in such examples, 
the ``comment'' often has already undergone various degrees of fossilization.
Changing the comment usually makes the sentences much less felicitous 
(\ref{ex:dayuchixiaoyu-2}),
at best highly marked.
This is strange if the attested examples are topic-comment constructions,
but makes sense if dephrasalization is needed 
to put the clause 大鱼吃小鱼 etc. to the ``comment'' position.

Thus, in \eqref{ex:dayuchixiaoyu} and \eqref{ex:nikankanwo},
the so-called topic is an ordinary subject,
and the so-called comment is a predicate.
The meaning of the result of dephrasalization 
may be compared with the English colloquial 
\form{I was like, \dots} construction.

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:dayuchixiaoyu} 他们[大鱼吃小鱼]（，厮杀成一片）
    \ex\label{ex:nikankanwo} 他们[你看看我我看看你]
    
    \ex\label{ex:dayuchixiaoyu-2} \begin{xlist}
        \ex *他们小鱼咬大鱼 
        \ex *他们虾米啃泥底
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Type 2: Quantificational adverbial looking like the inner subject}

The second type of ``dangling topic'' is like \eqref{ex:shui-dou-bu-pa}.
A topic-comment analysis of \eqref{ex:shui-dou-bu-pa} 

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:shui-dou-bu-pa} \gll 他们 谁 都 不 怕 \\
    3pl who even \acs{neg} fear \\
    \glt \translate{They don't fear anyone.}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Type 3: Ellipsis leaving a subject and one predicate}

Some people accept \eqref{ex:nasuofangzixingkuimeixiaxue}.
Here the \acs{np} 那所房子 definitely doesn't come from the words following it,
and is therefore recognized as a topic by some (TODO: ref). 
Note, however, that 幸亏 serves as a clause linker outside \eqref{ex:nasuofangzixingkuimeixiaxue}:
\eqref{ex:xingkui-buran-ex} is a demonstration of the 幸亏……不然…… linking construction,
and we also have its topicalized version \eqref{ex:xingkui-buran-fronted}. (TODO: whether this is parenthesis)
We also know in a clause linking construction,
often one clause can be omitted in the utterance because it's content can be easily inferred (TODO: ref).
So now the origin of \eqref{ex:nasuofangzixingkuimeixiaxue} is clear:
We can get it by omitting the second clause in the comment part of \eqref{ex:xingkui-buran-fronted}.
Indeed, if we replace 幸亏 by anything that is adverbial but not a clause linker,
the resulting sentence -- which now contains a real dangling topic -- is not grammatical.

\begin{exe}
    \ex \label{ex:nasuofangzixingkuimeixiaxue} \gll \% 那 所 房子 幸亏 没 下雪 \\
    {} that \acs{classify} house fortunate \acs{neg} snow \\
    \glt \translate{For that house, fortunately it didn't snow (or otherwise something bad would happen).}

    \ex\label{ex:xingkui-buran-ex} \gll [幸亏] 去年 没 下雪 ， [不然] 那 所 房子 早就 塌 了 \\
    fortunate last.year \acs{neg} snow {} otherwise that \acs{classify} house already collapse \acs{sfp} \\
    \glt \translate{Fortunately it didn't snow last year, or otherwise that house has already collapsed.}

    \ex\label{ex:xingkui-buran-fronted} 
    \gll [ 那 所 房子 ]_{\text{topic}} [ 幸亏 去年 没 下雪 ， 不然 早就 塌 了 ]_{\text{comment}} \\
    {} that \acs{classify} house {} {} fortunate last.year \acs{neg} snow {}  otherwise already collapse \acs{sfp} \\
\end{exe}

\subsection{Type 4: Extraction from prepositional adverbials}

\eqref{ex:zhejianshinibunengjiumafantayigeren} in \prettyref{sec:topicalization-of-preposition-objects} 
is sometimes regarded as an instance of the dangling topic construction.
However, as is shown in \prettyref{sec:topicalization-of-preposition-objects},
it may just be from topicalization of an \acs{np} in an adverbial,
with the preposition (and/or the locative particle) removed.

\subsection{Type 5: Nominal predicate}

\begin{exe}
    \ex 这种青菜一斤三十块钱
\end{exe}

\subsection{Type 6: Locational adverbial mistaken for the subject}

\begin{exe}
    \ex \gll \% 物价 纽约 最 贵  \\
    {} price New.York most expensive \\
    \glt \translate{The price in New York is the most expensive.}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Tentative conclusion}

The conclusion is all topics in Chinese are closely linked to a position in the comment,
be it a core argument position or a peripheral one.
So the notion of dangling topics is to be rejected in Mandarin grammar,
and we can always recover the ``canonical'' i.e. non-topic-comment clause
from a topic-comment construction.
After this, if the canonical clause can be divided into an \acs{np}
or a complement clause and a verbal constituent following it,
we can uncontroversially say the first is the subject while the second is the predicate. (TODO: predicate def)
So equating the subject with the topic is also wrong.

It's possible to find the semantic role of the subject isn't agentive;
in this case I assert there is a valency changing mechanism here.

\begin{infobox}{What to expect when people talk about the subject or the topic}{subject-topic}
    Unfortunately, despite the syntactic tests presented above,
    there are still many people -- even many native speakers -- 
    promoting the idea that the Mandarin topic has nothing different with the subject.
    Here is a list of TODO: ref
