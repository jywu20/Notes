Approaches to evolution of language
======

Finding "simple" structures in modern languages
- pros: Philologists feeling at home
- cons: They are modern language constructions, anyway, and what structures are really simple is highly debated

Iterated learning paradigm
- pros: Experimentally tractable in the lab
- cons: Generic for any learning task: no special mention of language
