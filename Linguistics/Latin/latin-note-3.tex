\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The language and the speaker}

\subsection{Latin as a classical language}

Latin was the language of the Romans
and the official language of both the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire,
and hence the official language of the Catholic Church, 
which was \emph{the} church for the Western Roman Empire. 
The international nature of the Roman Empire made Latin 
the international language around the Mediterranean Sea at that time -- 
indeed, \form{Mare Nostrum} \translate{our sea} in Latin,
and its importance in science, arts, law, religion, and literature 
lent it more than one thousand of years of life 
as a common literary language and a sacred language in western Europe
after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire 
and the emergence of the Romance language family.

As recently as the nineteen century,
Latin was still fluently used by scholars and in the Catholic Mass. 
A decline in the popularity of Latin was observed after that.
The rapid development of English (at first, also French and German and sometimes Russian)
as the language of science 
largely replaced the status of Latin as a scholar language.
After Vatican allowed vernacular languages being used in liturgies, 
Latin also largely lose its position in the daily use in the Catholic church. 

This note is about \concept{Classical Latin} -- the Latin of classical Latin writers -- 
and \concept{Ecclesiastical Latin} -- the kind of Latin of the Catholic church.
That's to say Old Latin, vulgar Latin (with prototypes of Romance articles), etc.
are not discussed in detail in this note.
Still, some historical knowledge is important for us to understand 
why Latin is the way it is. 

\subsection{Latin in ancient Mediterranean world}

The historical and contemporary importance of Latin 
of course doesn't endorse it as a inherently superior language. 
Indeed, Latin used to be TODO: other languages were more important

We only have a handful of Latin texts before 600BC; 
as a comparison, there are about 150 pre-600BC Etruscan texts.
Even in the period between 600BC and 100BC, 
during which we have around 3000 Latin texts,
we have about 9000 Etruscan texts, 
which is three times as many as their Latin counterparts. 


\section{Theoretical orientation}\label{sec:theoretical-orientation}

{\small

\subsection{Constituency and dependency relations}

In a word, the theoretical framework of this note 
is \ac{blt}\citep{dixon2009basic1,dixon2010basic2,dixon2012basic3}
with generative flavors.
Here by \term{generative} I mean 
Minimalism plus Distributed Morphology plus Syntactic Cartography 
(but the Antisymmetry theory is not strictly followed here; 
I only use the idea of a semi-rigid template of functional projections).
Although generativism is harshly criticized by Dixon, 
I believe this is largely due to notational reasons;
some criticisms, like ``generativism sticks to the universal notation of words''
or ``generativists blindly believe in a 
noun-verb distinction \emph{exactly} the same as English'',
are invalid in the aforementioned framework. 
To connect the aforementioned school of generativism and \ac{blt}, 
I list some observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, note that ``functional heads'' are just 
        an alternative way to say ``grammatical categories'' or ``grammatical relations''
        in a constituency-based framework doing away with dependency relations.
        The constituency-dependency correspondence 
        has long been discovered 
        \citep{schneider1998linguistic,osborne2011bare,kahane2015syntactic,nefdt2023notational}. 
        On the other hand, 
        ``lexical heads'' -- nouns, verbs, etc. -- 
        lie at the \emph{bottom} of an ``extended \ac{np}'' (i.e. the DP projections) 
        or an ``extended \ac{vp}'' (i.e. the CP projections).
        This settles the issue raised by many descriptive linguists: 
        the term \term{head} is no longer used in the same way 
        as it was in contemporary generativism.
        The \term{head} of descriptive linguists is essentially the \term{root} in Distributed Morphology.
    \item It's possible to ``compress'' the Minimalist constituency (or dependency) structure: 
        removing invisible functional projections, 
        replacing labels like SpecTP with ``subject'',
        using the term \term{head} to refer to the lexical head, etc.
        Thus, we are able to automatically 
        obtain more traditional constituency analysis (as in \citet{cgel})
        or dependency analysis 
        from generative trees. 
        The counterpart of c-command relations in the dependency analysis 
        is how ``tight'' a dependency relation is:
        that the relation between the verb and the object is tighter 
        than the relation between the verb and the subject 
        is equivalent to that the subject has a higher position in the syntactic tree.
    \item One implicit message hidden in the idea that 
        \acs{np}s and clauses are the only two types of constituents 
        in \citet{dixon2009basic1}  
        is that when we finish building up an \acs{np} 
        and insert it into an argument slot in a clause, 
        the syntactic processing enters a new stage;
        on the other hand, the difference between a half-finished \acs{np}
        and a completely finished \acs{np}
        is not that huge.
        Now if we use constituency analysis all the way down, 
        we are in the risk of losing this piece of information.
        This is settled by the concept of \emph{phase} in modern generativism:
        when typologists argue for recognizing only noun phrases and clauses as constituents, 
        they are essentially referring to phases. 
    \item The phase theory also explains why some have the intuition that 
        the \term{verb phrase} should exclude the object: 
        because when the CP is being built, 
        the arguments are already ``frozen'', 
        and what are manipulated and realized together 
        are verbal functional heads -- that's exactly \emph{their} verb phrase. 
        The similar thing happens for a \term{word} (see the next point). 
    \item Some people (many functionalists, but also some formal grammarians) 
        really don't like the idea that 
        differences in constituent order have their roots in 
        the constituent structure and especially in movements. 
        They say constituent order \emph{directly} reflects 
        grammatical relations and categories like topicalization, 
        instead of the mainstream generative idea that 
        constituent order reflects constituency relations,
        which then codes things like topicalization. 
        The exact meaning of ``directly reflect'' however is rather hard to tell 
        from an empirical perspective.
        What we already know is that
        quantitative researches suggest that 
        at least a semi-configurational approach 
        (i.e. a linear template with fixed constituent slots in it)
        is needed to fully capture Latin constituent order, 
        because the diachronic change of the frequency of OVAux
        looks very different from the diachronic change of the overall OV frequency,
        which includes, say, OAuxV \citep{danckaert2015studying}.
        But after we accept the semi-configurational approach, 
        we can then do tests like, say, Principles A, B, and C, 
        coordination and ellipsis tests, etc.,
        on slots of these templates, 
        and usually a hierarchy of 
        relative ``strength '' of dependency relations
        can be established 
        \citep[\citesec{1.6}]{danckaert2017development}.
        Then, by the duality between constituency and dependency, 
        usually we will find 
        that a constituency-based analysis is \emph{accurate} for 
        a so-called non-configurational language, 
        although it may not be \emph{convenient} 
        for its documentation.
    \item Finally, the hierarchy of functional heads -- or in other words, 
        grammatical relations and categories -- 
        can be ``routinized'' and packaged,
        and how they are stored in the actual brain 
        may have more resemblance to \ac{tag}. 
        Most inflection patterns, for example, 
        seem to be packaged, 
        which explains why sometimes they seem to be psychologically different from syntax, 
        though Distributed Morphology has shown it's possible to treat the grammar 
        as syntax all the way down. 
        This is just what people call \term{construction}.
        However, it seems a construction is still not a packaged \emph{linear} sequence: 
        its inner structure still observes the usual rules for syntax 
        and may (although of course sometimes may not) engage 
        actively with productive syntactic elements. 
        Thus a structuralist -- as opposed to canonical constructivism -- 
        analysis is still valuable.
        Note that the adoption of functional hierarchy à la Cinque 
        also means the distinction between adjuncts and complements/specifiers 
        is eliminated, 
        and the argument-adjunct distinction then becomes epiphenomenal 
        and is no longer a primitive concept in grammar:
        like the concept of subject, 
        argumenthood of a clausal dependent 
        is now defined by a collection of more primitive properties, 
        each of which may assume cross-linguistic variation
        \citep{mcinnerney2022argument}.
        A clausal dependent position may be defined as an argument 
        because of semantic reasons,
        or because of the verb root can't be realized 
        without the existence of that clausal dependent
        \citep[\citechap{9}]{siddiqi2009syntax},
        or because of its base position is lower than what is traditionally 
        known as adjuncts.
        Of course, the general tendency is to identify all the three criteria,
        but corner cases like 
        that one semantic argument is syntactically omitted
        or that an applicative device regularly
        attaches an optional argument to the core argument structure
        happens all the time; 
        worrying too much about the argument-adjunct distinction 
        (or similar issues) is probably not wise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The word}

\subsubsection{Wordhood}

Three criteria are involved in wordhood determination -- 
or, to be more accurate, what people call words,
since as we are going to see, 
although each of the definition of wordhood 
seems to have its status in the grammar cross-linguistically,
we shouldn't expect there to be any strong implicational relation 
among the three types of wordhood.

\paragraph{Three definitions of wordhood} The three criteria are: 
syntactic status as a mini-constituent 
(although how small they should be is not without controversy: 
usually we say grammatical relations realized as compounding or affixation 
are word-level relations, 
but this definition is already influenced by 
intuition from morphological and phonological wordhood);
realizational (or ``post-syntactic'') morphological  status 
as a unit with a fixed template;
status as a phonological unit surrounded with word boundaries.

In the first definition, a word is just a mini-phrase 
(in the above phase-as-descriptivist-phrase sense, 
possibly a mini-tree, possibly a collective realization of a span of functional heads).
The syntax all the way down analysis taken in this note 
therefore explains why we always have controversies 
concerning whether a unit is a word or a phrase 
(like \form{American history teacher} 
-- note that its inner parts don't actively participate in other syntactic processes):
this is no objective standard for drawing a line between the two. 
What are objective are the morphosyntactic units recognized: 
\form{American history teacher} is a nominal compounding structure 
(a certain kind of FP below the NumP projection),
regardless of whether you say it's a word. 

The first definition of wordhood largely overlooks 
case or \acs{tame} affixes:
they are technically categories within the \acs{np} or the clause, 
and not categories within the syntactic word.
In other words it is about the difference 
between, say, nominal derivation and modification in the noun phrase.
The morphological definition, on the other hand, 
is about how functional items are realized, 
or in other words, it's about the distinction 
between the affix and the auxiliary.
We can say it's more about inflection.

According to Cartography syntax, 
cross-linguistically, 
we should find similar patterns of functional heads,
so we should expect to see a morphosyntactic unit 
of a size similar to what we usually call words in English 
in another language, 
although the native speakers may not find this unit important in their society 
(for example, the ``word'' unit defined by syntactic scrunity 
may not be the unit for measuring the length of an article or for writing).

This definition of wordhood, however, 
despite capturing the essence of the underlying abstract structure of the language, 
can't be relied on as the only definition of wordhood:
under this definition we may even casually say that 
\form{has been eating} is a word!

There is another criterion: 
a word is something with an established meaning,
like you can't infer the meaning of the physics jargon \form{re-norm-al-ize} 
from its structure, so it's a word.
This idea -- that a word needs to be memorized as a whole -- 
leads to the word-based approach to morphology,
where a word's morphological relation with other words (i.e. the paradigm)
is encoded as a schema.
This approach avoids unnecessary choices between possible constituency analysis of words,
accounts for non-concatenative morphology in a straightforward way
as well as the existence of non- or semi-productive morphological rules
\citep[\citechap{3, 4}]{haspelmath2013understanding}.
Still, all of the phenomenon above
seem to be due to the fact that 
words are small in their syntactic sizes, 
and not that there is a universal distinction 
between morphology that can be easily fossilized 
and syntax that is hard to fossilized.
Even clause can occasionally get established meanings,
sometimes with archaic structure preserved util today,
like \form{till death do us part}.
Non-concatenative morphology can already be accounted for 
by morphological and phonological rules well attested in other languages 
\citep{tucker2011morphosyntax};
they work for words and not phrases, 
also purely because morphophonological rules are highly local 
and don't have the ability to permute larger objects.
The ``word as minimal component of utterance'' 
criterion is therefore a consequence of the first criterion above 
and not an independent one.

\paragraph{Relations between the three definitions} 
Variance in morphology is constrained by syntactic factors,
like what is embedded into the morphological realization of the verb 
can't be grammatical categories in the \acs{np}, etc.
The phonological word in principle is orthogonal to 
the morphological word and the purely syntactic word,
but in reality they of course have to have correlation
or otherwise the language will be hard to use in practice.

In some languages like Mandarin, 
the morphological word almost completely faithfully represents 
the underlying abstract syntactic word, 
while the phonological word may have complicated relations with the former.

In Latin, it's quite the opposite: 
Latin is heavy in inflection, 
so many grammatical categories with scopes over much larger constituents, 
like case or tense, 
``condense'' unto nouns and verbs, 
so what a morphological word reflects 
is the structure of the \acs{np} or clause that surround it;
but the difference between phonological wordhood 
and morphological wordhood is small. 
Note, however, that if we change the definition of a constituent 
into ``the current \acs{np} or clause minus its already finished complements'',
as in \prettyref{sec:theoretical-orientation},
then a Latin morphological word is indeed a mini-constituent.
So indeed we can say Latin inflected words,
despite being defined using phonological and morphological standards,
do bear syntactic significance,
although its syntactic status 
is not a mini-constituent but a phase (in generative terms).
This means syntactic wordhood and realizational morphological wordhood
are kind of intermingled;
thus the two types of wordhood are often 
merged into ``grammatical'' wordhood \citet[\citesec{10.4}]{dixon2010basic2}. 

Essentially, this also means the boundary between inflection and derivation 
can't be established ubiquitously:
markers of valence changing device
reside in relatively high positions in the \vP{}, 
which may be used to question their status as derivational affixes;
so valency changing marking is inflection,
but then this notion goes against the terminology in \citet{jacques2021grammar}.
Other definitions like ``inflection is obligatory morphology induced by the environment''
or ``inflection involves agreement''
can be as well easily rejected because of corner cases 
\citep[\citesec{5.3}]{dixon2009basic1}. 
This justifies the syntax-all-the-way-down viewpoint in 
\prettyref{sec:theoretical-orientation},
since there is no substantial difference 
between what's \emph{inside} the verb and what's \emph{around} the verb.

\paragraph{Function word} The criteria listed above are all about content words;
whether a grammatical item is recognized as a function word 
is decided \emph{after} we recognize all content words
(and therefore often doesn't provide additional information about the grammar).
And the criteria used to decide what's a function word 
are also not homogeneous.
The phonological and the realizational morphological criterion are still valid;
people may add that an affix should not have its own inflection,
but they \emph{can} have contextual allomorphs 
which are historically inflection of auxiliaries,
raising the question what ``its own inflection'' means 
(think about Japanese verb conjugation).
The syntactic criterion is now invalid; 
people may propose alternative criteria like 
``a function word is an immediate constituent of the \acs{np} or the clause
and not the noun or the verb'',
but then \acs{tame} affixes belong to the clause and not just the verb
and definitely we don't want to recognize them as words.
In most cases, when people do affix-word distinction on a function item, 
they are talking about phonological and realizational morphological factors,
although sometimes when these factors are already thoroughly investigated, 
the affix-word terminological distinction may be used 
to describe the syntactic status of the item 
(for example, by saying ``Mandarin monosyllabic locational words 
are words, although they are not independent in the prosodic sense'',
what we actually want to say is Mandarin location words are licensed 
in the \acs{np}, not in the head noun).

\subsubsection{(Realizational) morphology}

Now we move to the topic of morphology,
and focus on how abstract syntactic categories are realized on a word.
``Syntax within the word'',
like regular derivation,
is also discussed in the name of morphology,
but here we focus on the realizational aspect of morphology.

\paragraph{What's a stem} Prototypically, the verb conjugation in a language is described by 
a series of morphological devices that take \emph{the} verb stem as the input,
and give conjugated verb forms as the final product.
This is indeed the case for Latin nouns (\prettyref{sec:regular-noun-declension})
and for English regular verbs:
the infinitive form is taken in,
and third-person singular \form{-s}, past tense \form{-ed}, 
past participle \form{-ed}, and the gerund-participle \form{-ing}
are attached according to the syntactic environment.
Sometimes the process is a little more irregular but not that irregular:
\emph{several} stems can be identified, each of which is fed into different morphosyntactic machines.
In other words, we have irregular stem alternation.
Again, for English irregular verbs,
there are three stems: the infinitive stem (e.g. \form{go}), 
the preterite stem (e.g. \form{went})
and the past participle stem (e.g. \form{gone}).
The step to feed stems into morphosyntactic machine is irregular,
but everything else is regular:
irregular, in this case, does appear, but it appear \emph{regularly}:
it only appears in certain parts.
The irregularity of stem alternation is so prevalent
that if the conjugation paradigm of a verb can be described with a few stems,
the verb is deemed as regular, 
despite the fact that such verbs are obviously irregular by the standard of English.

\paragraph{Stem alternation as mini conjugation classes} 
This phenomenon -- that a verb has more than one stem, i.e. irregular stem alternation
-- is frequent cross-linguistically
(\citealt{jacques2021grammar} \citesec{12.2}, \citealt{forker2020grammar} \citesec{11.2}, among others).
Usually, certain correlation between the stem varieties can still be recognized,
and verbs can be grouped accordingly,
which, if the linguist truly will, 
can be (though tediously) summarized as more fine-grained conjugation classes.
This is also the case for Latin (\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.stem}).

\paragraph{Stem excluded from primary concepts in morphosyntax} 
The notion of \concept{stems} isn't really essential in the description of morphosyntactic:
it can well be modeled by environment-dependent vocabulary insertion rules 
and/or post-syntactic operations.
When certain correlations can still be built between so-called suppletive forms,
what happens may be analyzed as in \citet{embick2005status},
where certain stems receive morphophonological readjustment
(according to the aforementioned hyper fine-grained conjugation subclasses).
Thus, it's not true suppletion:
it's just a corner case of non-concatenative morphology.
When these readjustment rules are fossilized,
suppletion -- like the English \form{good}/\form{better} -- 
may just be the result of conditional insertion,
as is outlined in \citet{siddiqi2009syntax}.

\paragraph{Strong irregularity in stem alternation usually restricted to light verbs} 
A general tendency about suppletion
is truly suppletive verbs are usually light verbs 
(in the surface-oriented sense),
with meanings like \translate{do}, \translate{come}, etc.
This may come from the fact that conditional realization of the root -- 
as opposed to grammatical items --
is somehow ``heavy'' and not favorable.
When we forbid conditional realization of roots,
\citep{embick2005status},
unrestricted suppletion can only be the result of 
vocabulary insertion rules of functional heads;
certain degree of suppletion can still be realized by readjustment rules,
which however are restricted in their computational capacity.
Thus, real lexical verbs are highly unlikely to have truly irregular suppletion;
if a verb is truly suppletive,
then it's highly likely to be 
the spellout of \vP{} functional heads.

\paragraph{Are paradigms primitive concepts?} 
In an inflected word, apart from the stem, 
we have inflectional affixes (with possible stem alternation) described by the paradigm.
Although the paradigm is definitely an important concept 
in \emph{performance} (as shortcuts people use when inflecting a word),
similar to the case of the stem,
it doesn't seem to be necessary 
in a model about what is \emph{possible} in languages.
Phenomena usually attributed to the status of the paradigm in 
the mental grammar 
can be easily accounted for using Distributed Morphology as well 
\citep{embick2000features,bobaljik2002syncretism}.

\subsection{Documenting the language}

Elements of a language, in the perspective of Distributed Morphology,
contain Lists A, B, and C, 
which are a list of roots and features, 
a list of how List A is phonetically realized 
(and also covers some syntactic selections that don't have semantic motivation: 
``if A and B meet, they never get appropriately spelt out and the derivation crashes -- no why''),
and the meaning of idiomatic phrases. 
With functional heads being kicked out in a practical language description project, 
the same amount of information needs to be shown in a different matter. 
What we need now are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Abstract syntax and ``abstract morphology'':
        facts like that Latin has six cases, 
        that Latin has well-defined subjects and objects, etc. 
        The grammatical concepts are knitted into subcategorization frames,
        each of which waits for a lexical head 
        and some arguments being filled in. 
        This covers the List A and the abstract part of List B 
        (i.e. what structures can be spelt out, 
        without considering what \emph{is} the realization)
    \item How the above is realized: 
        actual nominal and verbal paradigms, 
        productive derivation rules, 
        constituent order, which may involve ``transformation rules''.
        This covers 
        the concrete part of List B. 
        The last section describes the procedure to study realizational morphology.

        The term \term{transformation rule} is kind of misleading 
        because it's possible -- and even frequent -- 
        that a marked construction can't be obtained by transformation 
        of the canonical construction
        in a natural way, 
        because what really happens is 
        that the two constructions undergo shared stages of syntactic structure building,
        and then diverge from each other,
        and the transformational rule linking the two 
        is only a coarse phenomenological description of the relation between the two 
        (\prettyref{fig:transformation-rule}).
    \item A dictionary, 
        containing roots, how roots are placed into subcategorization frames, 
        and established meanings of complex constructions (all things in List C). 
        The discussion on (synchronic) roots may also involve 
        historical morphology,
        the products of which are syntactically independent roots.
        The last includes some semi-fossilized derivations 
        idioms in the everyday sense, formulaic speech, etc. 
        Usually dictionaries don't really record roots: 
        they record already inflected principal parts,
        from which the whole paradigm can be found.
\end{itemize}
The first two are about the grammar, 
while the third is about the dictionary
or the so-called \concept{lexicon}.

\subsection{The nominal system}

\subsection{The verbal system}

\subsubsection{Verb conjugation}\label{sec:conjugation-form}

Different people use the term \term{verb forms} -- and count them -- in different ways.
The most generous -- and the most syntactically relevant -- way 
is to view the realization of every possible CP-TP-\vP{} projection 
as a form of the main verb -- the verb root at the core of the CP-TP-\vP{} domains.
This results in a paradigm in traditional grammar, 
essentially the traditional way to enumerate Latin verb forms 
(``the indicative active present second person form of a verb is \dots'').

The problem with this approach is sometimes two cells in the paradigm are always identical.
In this way, morphosyntactically there are indeed two different paradigm cells,
but morphophonologically there is only one verb form.
Take English as an example: 
a traditional grammar may say 
``the present subjunctive first person singular of English \form{take} is \form{take}''. 
The problem here is the present subjunctive first person singular \emph{clause}
always contains the same form of the \emph{verb}
with a present indicative first person singular clause,
so it makes no sense to talk about ``the present subjunctive first person singular \emph{verb form}''.
A linguist stingy with the number of verb forms 
may then stipulate that conjugation forms are literally about \emph{forms},
and thus there is no such thing as ``the subjunctive form'' of English verbs,
because in subject \emph{clauses}, 
the main verb always has the same form as the infinitive
\citep[\citepage{76}]{cgel}.

Another problem with this approach occurs 
when dealing with languages like Japanese.
There are so many suffix slots,
and the boundaries between suffixes are relatively clear,
so the paradigm is too big to be displayed as a whole
and too regular to be enumerated cell by cell.
In this case, recording suffixes may be a better choice.

The analysis of conjugation forms of the verb, theoretically speaking,
is more about vocabulary insertion and readjustment rules,
instead of the syntax proper.
This is an instance of the \emph{separation principle}:
morphophonological features can be separated from morphosyntactic features
\citep{embick2000features}.
Distinguishing between verb forms and clause categories isn't just a game about wording:
in periphrastic conjugation,
we have auxiliary verb(s) plus a non-finite verb form,
but here the non-finite verb form is just the spellout of several features together with the verb root 
and is definitely not thea head of a non-finite \emph{clause}:
what we have here is one clause, not clause embedding.
Thus it makes no sense to say ``we use a non-finite verb form in a periphrastic construction'',
because finiteness is a category of a clause,
and here is no clause combining.
This is also relevant for surface-oriented descriptive linguistics:
\citet[\citepage{74,83}]{cgel} rejects the notion of the \term{infinitive form} of the verb,
and replace the term by \term{default form},
because the so-called infinitive form also appears in the subjunctive mood
or the imperative mood. 
Despite this, to respect the tradition, 
I will still use the term \term{non-finite verbs} 
or wordings like ``the perfect passives are formed by attaching forms of copula to the perfect participle''.

The generous paradigm-cell-as-verb-form approach fortunately works in Latin 
because Latin is morphologically rich
and thanks to historical changes,
the boundaries between suffixes marking each grammatical category 
are already vague enough, so the Japanese School Grammar approach is also not applicable. 
So it does make sense to talk about 
``the indicative active perfect second person singular form'' of a verb.
Similarly, we also talk about non-finite verb forms (\prettyref{sec:non-finite-abs}),
though strictly speaking, finiteness is a category of the clause.

\subsubsection{Argument structure}\label{sec:a-position}

\paragraph{Three aspects of verb valency} 
To achieve a disciplined analysis of verb valency, 
we may adopt a multiple-step analysis of A-positions
(i.e. the positions in the syntactic frame of a verb):
at least two steps -- the \vP{} step and the TP step 
-- are to be distinguished in syntax, 
apart from the purely semantic verb classification.
Thus, a three-step model -- 
the steps being pure semantics
(``Manipulator'' or ``Target'', i.e. those listed in \citet{dixon2005semantic}), 
coarse-grained argument semantic roles with syntactic significance 
\citep[\citesec{4.2}]{cgel}, 
and clausal dependent positions directly analyzable using constituent order or case
(subject, object, etc.) -- 
is needed to fully cover verb valency.
Note that in this note it's \emph{not} assumed that 
a completely transparent mapping exists 
from semantics to syntax.
In English, for example, \form{I like this} 
(\form{this} represents an event)
is semantically complement-taking 
but involves no complement clause construction syntactically;
and it's possible to leave out a semantic argument in the syntactic frame of a verb.

\paragraph{Necessity to talk about ``syntactic''  semantic roles} 
In practice usually we will conflate these ``syntactic'' semantic roles 
and more apparent clausal dependent slots 
and compare these syntactic concepts 
-- essentially A-positions -- with purely semantic concepts.
This approach is bound to be fruitful, 
since no one-to-one relation exists between A-positions and pure semantic roles.%
\footnote{
    Similar things happen in event structure: 
    A Secondary verb is different from, say, an auxiliary verb in the verbal system
    in the eye of syntax 
    and at the syntax-semantic interface:
    the lexical verb \form{start}, for example, 
    introduces a new event besides the event that the agent is start to do, 
    while an inchoative aspect, 
    if in the grammatical aspect region and not the lexical aspect region,
    reflects the speaker's attitude
    (possibly by shifting the time referred to 
    to the initial part of the whole situation),
    but they are of course equivalent to each other,
    although their interpretations 
    immediately at the syntax-semantic interface 
    are different.
}
But it's still not enough: in passivization, 
while the agent argument still occupies a higher position,
it receives an inherent case (quite similar to how DPs are licensed by prepositions)
and is thus unable to move to the subject position.
This demonstrates the necessity to distinguish \emph{two} layers of grammatical relations in A-positions.
Dixon refers to them as ``deep'' and ``surface'' argument slots, 
and this notation is also taken in this note.

On the other hand it may be tempting to conflate 
``syntactic'' semantic roles with purely semantic roles 
and compare them with apparently analyzable clausal dependent positions 
like subject, object, etc.
Indeed, ``syntactic'' semantic roles -- \term{thematic roles} in generative syntax -- 
are first obtained with coarse-graining of 
various verb-specific semantic roles,
and then we find a strong correlation between thematic roles 
and their deep syntactic positions, 
and this gives rise to the Uniformity of Theta-Assignment Hypothesis (UTAH).
So in principle conflating the two should have no problem
as long as we choose the correct coarse graining method.
The problem however is this often goes against the tradition:
we often say \form{the stick} in \form{I hit the wall with the stick} and 
\form{I hit the stick to the wall}
have the same purely semantic role (the thing manipulated by the agent),
but their syntactic semantic roles are completely different
(instrument v.s. patient);
this difference is reflected in semantics, 
since we would say the second example focuses on the stick,
but still people usually think this difference is kind of small.

Some alternations, like the alternation of the clausal complement position of 
the experiencer roles in  
\form{he fears the police} and \form{the police frightens him},
are hard to locate: 
they may be different in the \vP{} step,
or they are the same in the \vP{} step but something else decides 
which argument becomes the subject.
But anyway, the above discussion means it's necessary to create 
a layer of ``syntactic'' semantic roles
between purely semantic concepts and surface clausal slots.

\paragraph{A-positions in an accusative language} 
Assignment of the accusative case is said to be done within the \vP region.
Then comes the TP step, in which
usually the highest argument position in the \vP{} step -- also the most agentive one --
becomes SpecTP, 
which is better known as the subject.

\paragraph{Generalized semantic roles and ambiguity in terminology} 
The tendency to use ``surface-orientated terms'' in typology 
somehow makes the terminology concerning the 
above three steps in syntactic derivation confusing.\footnote{
    Here \term{derivational} means what it means in modern generative grammar, 
    that grammatical structures are built by successive applications of (possibly internal) Merge.
    It \emph{doesn't} mean \emph{transformational operations}
    in early versions of generative grammar.
}
So-called generalized semantic roles like S, A, P, etc.
are used to refer to labels in all the three steps, 
and when they are used in describing the last two steps,
they are \emph{syntactic} labels, despite the name. 
The following example demonstrates this chaos.
Consider an unaccusative verb in an accusative language,
like \form{hurt} in \form{my fingers hurt}.\footnote{
    Note that unaccusativity has nothing to do with alignment:
    we can have unaccusative verbs in a typical accusative language, like English.
} 
In the argument structure of an unaccusative verb,
no agentive argument is present,
so we may say there is no A argument. 
The deep P argument becomes the surface S argument,
which then may be neutralized with the A argument since in accusative languages S=A.
Similarly the meaning of the term \term{semantic role}
needs to be inferred from the context.
This is also an example why we need to tell deep argument positions (i.e. positions in \vP{})
from surface argument positions (positions after TP or even CP is built).

\paragraph{Ergativity and split of grammatical relation labels}
It should be noted that labels for A-positions, like \term{subject},
are bundles of several syntactic functions
(in the case of \term{subject}, 
it's the external argument which governs all internal complements, 
the receiver of the nominative case, and, say, SpecDoP, 
where Do or something else is the highest light verb in the \vP{} field).
When these syntactic functions are disassembled with each other, 
the corresponding collective label no longer makes sense.
Thus in a morphological ergative language, 
the ``nominative case receiver'' syntactic function is absent, 
and the A argument of a transitive verb receives an inherent case, 
so the A argument loses the morphological resemblance with the 
S argument for intransitive verbs, 
but it keeps the syntactic functions of 
the highest argument; 
for syntactic ergativity, 
the external argument property is given to the P argument \citep{aldridge2008generative}.
In both cases, grammatical relations condensed into the label \term{subject} 
need to be taken out one by one and redistributed to new collective terms.

\paragraph{Valence changing} From a generative perspective, some languages realize valency changing 
by a series of \vP{} structures, and then the case assignment of the arguments is trivial.
Some languages use non-trivial structural case assignment mechanisms
to achieve valency changing 
(``suppressing the agent argument, 
and leave the nominative probe to find the subject;
the probe then has to choose the patient argument'').
Of course, \vP{} changes in the second type are still there,
which may be a likely source of relevant verb morphology.
Naturally, the second group of languages have more restricted valency changing devices;
this is the case of Latin.

\paragraph{Deponent verbs} 
In the analysis in \citet{embick2000features} 
a verb is deponent if its root is only able to 
appear together with the passive Voice feature. 
When functional heads higher than the roots are realized,
the passive feature -- which may come from the root or from the passive light verb -- 
guides the realization of the person and number categories.
Then since the similarity between unaccusative verbs and passive verbs
(the surface S argument being the deep O argument),
we can expect that
the two may have similar behaviors at least in some languages,
which is already demonstrated by second language acquisition,
which arguably reflects the ``default'' parameter setting of languages \citep{balcom1997happened}.
Latin also has this phenomenon \citep[\citepages{308-309}]{oniga2014latin}.

\paragraph{Documenting complement types}

The traditional practice of Latin grammar research
is to classify clausal complement and adjunct types according to their case marking.
This strategy is also found in modern grammars.
Some introduce clausal complement types just in chapters about case marking 
\citep[\citechap{8}]{jacques2021grammar},
while other grammars, despite giving a brief description of the context of case marking,
spare some time to discuss complement types in the chapters about valency and clause structure 
\citep[\citesec{3.4}, \citechap{19}, \citechap{22}]{forker2020grammar}.
From a \ac{tag} perspective (\prettyref{sec:theoretical-orientation}), 
the two extremes are different in how they treat function labels:
in the former, the function label of a construction appears together with its category label on the root node,
while in the latter, the function is described separately from the form of what fills that position.
The former is more bottom-up, 
while the latter is more top-down.
The choice between the two, however, is usually language-dependent:
grammars for analytic languages, of course, have to lean even further to the 
``complement type as clause slot'' extreme 
and away from the ``complement type as case-form context'' extreme.
\citet{allen1903allen} uses a hybrid method:
the discussion about case marking (\citesec{39}) is separated from 
the discussion about complement and adjunct types (\citesec{338}),
so the top-down approach seems to be adopted,
but the latter is still arranged in terms of case.
This arises both from the distinct features of Latin and the intended readers:
the relation between complement types and cases is regular enough in Latin,
and what is most important for Latinists is to understand, at least sketchily, ancient writings, 
so a parsing-oriented grammar is much handier.

\subsubsection{Clause combining}

It's hard to draw a line between coordination and asymmetric (i.e. subordinating) clause linking 
(like concessive clauses).
Theoretically, this is because any clause combining construction follows the X-bar scheme:
one clause is the Specifier, 
and another clause is the Complement,
and certain asymmetry has to be introduced.
In English, the FANBOYS 
-- \form{for}, \form{and}, \form{nor}, \form{but}, 
\form{or}, \form{yet}, \form{so} -- are usually regarded as coordinating conjunctions.
But what's the essential difference between \form{although} and \form{but}?

On the other hand, adverbial clause constructions 
are uncontroversially asymmetric and can in theory be distinguished from clause linking:
in clause linking, the less important clause 
is base-generated in one Specifier position in the CP layer of the main clause,
so the two combined units are of roughly the same structure,
while adverbial clauses appear in the TP layer,
so the two combined units are of different structures:
the adverbial clause is a CP,
while the main clause, when the adverbial clause enters derivation,
is a TP.
Complement clauses, on the other hand, are first introduced in the \vP{} layer:
they are TPs or CPs,
while the main clause, when complement clauses enter the derivation,
are \vP s.
But there are still certain subtleties regarding the boundaries of \vP{}, TP, and CP.

Relative clauses are introduced in DPs, 
so the probability to confuse a relative clause construction 
with a complement clause construction is small -- but still not zero.
It can be expected that \form{I like the man dancing} and \form{I like the dancing man} 
are realized in quite similar ways.
Besides, some languages lack prototypical complement clause constructions 
but have complementation strategies.
That is, when they talk about \form{I like the dancing man},
a speaker of such a language may be implying that he or she actually likes the man's dancing,
though not the man's personality.
Now comes the question:
when there are vague evidences indicating the grammaticalization of this construction,
should we now claim the language has already developed a complement clause construction?

It's still possible to do the same thing 
-- largely symmetric coordination and certainly asymmetric subordination -- 
completely with \vP s.
The former results in clause chaining \citep{nonato2014clause},
while the latter results in serial verb constructions.
These construction types, however, are absent in Latin, and I will not go deep into them in this note.

\subsection{Constituent order and information packaging}

The fact that fine-grained constituency relation exists in Latin 
is probably not surprising because
even the most non-configurational languages show configurationality 
under scrutiny
\citep[among others]{niedzielski2017clausal,morris2018evidence,legate2002warlpiri}
and therefore a thorough disruption 
of the existing framework of generative syntax seems unnecessary.%
\footnote{
    There is still some left controversies over 
    whether prototypical non-configurational languages 
    have a \emph{different} constituent structure,
    like, say, the structure in pronominal argument hypothesis (PAH),
    in which argument positions are filled by pronominals 
    in the nucleus clause,
    while the \acs{np} ``arguments'' are base-generated topics 
    linked to the argument positions not by movement.
    Even though this seems plausible, 
    \cite{legate2002warlpiri} rejects the hypothesis.
}
Still, even though we know mainstream generative (constituency-based, 
though the introduction of movements and the structure of Cinque hierarchy
gives it certain flavor of dependency grammars) approaches make perfect sense for Latin,
a systematic and thorough description of Latin grammar 
would be better carried out in a dependency-relation based or \acs{blt}-based way.
This is of course mostly notational change:
for example, we only recognize the most ``salient'' types of constituents 
like \acs{np}s and clauses as constituents in our description,
and the existence of fine-grained functional projections is covered by 
additional information like the ``height'' or ``closeness'' of dependency arcs
corresponding to these functional projections
(\prettyref{sec:theoretical-orientation}).

\section{About this note}

This note roughly follows the example of 

Of course, it's still possible to carry out grammatical description in different ways.  
For example, generally we shouldn't separate morphology and syntax categorically.
For a heavily inflected language like Latin, however, 
it's an appealing idea 
to start a chapter named ``verbal morphology''
and cover all \acs{tame} marking in it, 
both the abstract concepts and the concrete paradigms.

\section{Typological parameters}

Some typological parameters and peculiar points of Latin 
are listed here for the impatient,
as well as some remarks on Latin in a more theoretical perspective.
For a bottom-up overview, 
see \prettyref{chap:pos}.

\subsection{Morphology}

Latin is well known for its rich morphology,
which enables a rather free -- but still not completely arbitrary (\prettyref{sec:clause.order})
-- constituent order.
Good agreement is shown between phonological and grammatical wordhood,
with exceptions like the clitic \form{-que}.

A stem can be well defined for both verbal and nominal morphology in Latin,
enabling a clear derivation-inflection distinction:
prototypical derivational processes that are considered 
to be a part of the head noun/verb 
and not the surrounding \acs{np}/clause
are morphologically realized strictly 
before prototypical inflection processes,
forming the stem 
(\prettyref{sec:noun.paradigm.introduction},
\prettyref{sec:verb.finite.paradigm}) to which 
inflection processes are applied,
with possible contextual allomorphs
(\prettyref{sec:phonology.morphological}). 
Latin inflection is always suffixal,
while derivation is predominantly prefixal.
Despite its richness, 
a large portion of instances of Latin derivation are historical,
with meanings of derived forms 
having significantly shifted and no longer regularly inferrable.

A general tendency in the stem structure 
is modification affixes usually are prefixes,
while affixes bearing grammatical information 
(like change of part of speech) 
are usually suffixes
(\prettyref{sec:np.noun}, TODO: ref).
Apart from affixation,
Latin does use compounding, as in \form{aequilibrium} 
(\form{aequ-i-libr-ium}, \translate{even-balance-\category{sg.nom}, equilibrium};
\citealt[\citesec{92}]{smith2016greek}),
but compounding was already less productive -- if not completely obsolete --
in the Classical period.

Concatenative morphology (affixation and compounding) 
is prominent but isn't the only morphological device.
Reduplication is attested in 
formation of the perfect stem (TODO: ref);
this however is largely historical 
and is no longer productive.
Dropping of first-conjugation stem-final vowel (\prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking})
may be analyzed as subtraction,
although it can be seen as due to morphophonological rules.
The imperfect \form{-ba-} is sometimes said to be an infix 
(as well as its counterparts like \form{-bi-}),
though it fits in a concatenative picture of verbal morphology.

\begin{infobox}{Advices when reading}{reading-advice}
    The morphological richness (and the scrambled constituent order)
    makes Latin hard to read 
    especially for people whose first languages are, say, 
    English or Mandarin. 
    Whenever unsure about a sentence, do the follows: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Skim over the words and label the stems that can be easily recognized.  
        \item Skim over and circle uncontroversial grammatical items,  
            like inflectional endings and prepositions. 
            It's OK to be unable to interpret them immediately (and we need the steps below).
        \item Choose a grammatical item and tentatively give a list of possible features it carries.  
            For example, seeing \form{-v-} in a verb usually means
            it's based on the perfect stem
            (\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.stem.perfect});
            \form{-um} may be second declension accusative,
            but there are other possibilities
            (\prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}). 
        \item Use constraints like 
            ``the preposition \form{in} licenses the accusative case or the ablative case'' 
            to narrow the possibilities identified above.
        \item Draw unfinished dependency arrows:
            for a verb, draw arrows pointing to the subject and/or the object; 
            for a nominative adjective, draw an arrow pointing to the modified head noun. 
            But note that it's possible that the subject is dropped, 
            or there is no head noun (compare English \form{the poor}).
            Then try to pair the arrows.
    \end{enumerate}
    Repeat the above procedure and finally the sentence can be understood. 
    This procedure is demonstrated in \prettyref{sec:text.vulgate.john}.
\end{infobox}

\subsection{The nominal system}

Lack of determiner

TODO: other IE languages

\subsection{The verbal system}

Most clausal grammatical categories are marked on the verbal morphology.
In English we have infinitive clauses,
but strictly speaking, there is no such thing as ``infinitive verb'':
the head verb of an infinitive clause 
has exactly the same form of a non-third person singular present tense verb.
In Latin however, the head verb of a infinitive clause in Latin 
indeed has a separate position in the paradigm.
Thus, the most salient clausal grammatical categories can be enumerated  
by observing verbal inflection (\prettyref{chap:verb}).


\subsection{Clausal dependents and alignment}

Latin is a clear nominative-accusative language.

(\prettyref{sec:core-argument-marking}).
In 


There is no serial verb constructions in Latin 
and thus semantic functions like location or instrument 
are always realized by typical peripheral arguments
attached to the core argument structure.
These peripheral argument positions sometimes can be filled by adverbs,
which also reveals an origin of adverbs: fossilized case forms.

\subsection{Clause combining}

In Latin there is no serial verb constructions.
Subordination strategies can be neatly summarized into 
complement clauses, relative clauses and adverbial clauses.


\chapter{Phonology and the writing system}

\section{Phonemes and the alphabet}

Although the phoneme inventory of a language 
often is not accurately reflected by its preferred system, 
since Latin is a classical language 
and no ancient Roman is alive today, 
its phonology has to be inferred from known texts. 

The most accepted writing system of Latin developed into 
what we call \concept{Latin letters} -- or the \concept{Roman alphabet} -- today, 
which is the most widely used writing system in the world.
\concept{Old Italic scripts},
used by Early Old Latin inscriptions 
as well as neighbor languages,
show a larger degree of variation, 
which clearly derived from Greek letters.
The standard Latin alphabet derived from old Italic scripts.
Note that ancient Romans only used the big letters;
the small letters was invented during the era of Charlemange.

The letter \form{J} was not used by ancient Romans, 
although we sometimes see \form{I} appearing at the start of a word 
and therefore possibly represents the semivowel /j/.
The letters \form{U} and \form{W} are also not used.
Similar to the case of \form{I},
the letter \form{V} is used to represent 
what appears to be the semivowel /w/ 
as well as the vowel /u/. 
The letter \form{K} is an archaic one 
and only appears before \form{A} in a small number of words
\citep[\citechap{2}]{oniga2014latin}.
The letters \form{Y} and \form{Z} are used to spell Greek words that 
include TODO: Y and the voiced dental affricate, respectively.

The Latin consonant inventory is therefore given by \citet[\citetable{3.1}]{oniga2014latin}.
Note that the letter \form{X} is a double consonant: 
it means /ks/ or /gs/.

Two semivowels -- /j/ and /w/ -- can be recognized,
which appear as \form{i} or \form{u}.

The vowels are given by \citet[\citetable{3.2}]{oniga2014latin}.
Each vowel has a long variety and a short variety.

\section{Prosody}



\section{Morphophonological rules}\label{sec:phonology.morphological}

Some phonological rules in Latin are sensitive to morpheme boundaries.
We can therefore assert that at least in a historical stage, 
Latin speakers had a clear sense of morphemes 
as real phonological objects,
instead of mere theoretical models.

\subsection{Vowel deletion}\label{sec:phonology.rule.deletion}

Short vowels \form{a}, \form{o} and \form{e} 
become zero before a morpheme boundary or another vowel
\citep[\citesec{8.3}]{oniga2014latin}.
This rule is exemplified by the absence 
of the thematic vowel in both declension (TODO: rosis)
and conjugation (TODO).

\subsection{Vowel shortening}\label{sec:phonology.rule.shortening}

A long vowel before another vowel or morpheme boundary 
is not deleted, but shortened.
Again this is exemplified (\prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking}, TODO: ref)

Also, in the final syllable of a phonological word,
a long vowel before a consonant except \form{s} is also shortened.
Counterexamples when the vowel is not in the final syllable exist,
like \form{b\={a}ris} \translate{a type of flat-bottomed freighter used on the Nile in Ancient Egypt}.

A long vowel is generally shortened before a sequence 
containing a liquid or nasal and a following stop consonant,
like \form{nt}.
This rule comes from an older Indo-European sound law: 
the Osthoff's Law
\citep[\citepage{55}]{oniga2014latin}.

\subsection{Vowel weakening}

When a short syllable is in a medial, open syllable,
and a morpheme boundary occurs immediately before, within or after the syllable,
it becomes \form{i} 
(\citealt[\citepage{55}]{oniga2014latin}; TODO: ref).

\subsection{Vowel lengthening}

A vowel is always \emph{lengthened} before \form{nf} and \form{ns}
\citep[\citepage{55}]{oniga2014latin}.

\chapter{Parts of speech}\label{chap:pos}

\section{Overview}

\subsection{Wordhood}

In this note I follow the traditional definition of Latin wordhood,
which is easily done using phonological criteria,
or, to be more accurate, orthographical criteria: 
what was documented by ancient Romans as a word 
is recognized as a word.
Latin is heavily inflectional,
and the grammatical categories seen in nominal and verbal morphology 
already reflect the most salient grammatical categories
in \acs{np}s and clauses;
words without inflectional morphology (so-called \concept{particles}) 
usually lack any synchronically active internal structures at all.
Thus, we can also say the traditional notion of Latin words 
indeed has morphosyntactic significance
and should be kept in use.

\subsection{Part of speech division}

Latin word classes can be defined easily via morphology
and these classes prove to have uniform morphosyntactic behaviors.
Non-particle words can be divided into two large classes:
those with similar morphology of prototypical nouns (i.e. \concept{declension}) are \concept{nominals},
while words with similar morphology of prototypical verbs (i.e. \concept{conjugation})
form a uniform class rightfully called \concept{verbs}.
Nominals include \concept{nouns} and \concept{adjectives},
the distinction between the two can also be defined morphologically.

Latin particles include \concept{prepositions}, \concept{adverbs},
\concept{interjections}, and \concept{conjunctions}.
The adverb class and the preposition class have a large overlap:
often a preposition has an intransitive counterpart,
which is similar to a prototypical adverb.
Conjunctions may be seen as ``prepositions for clauses''.
The functions and etymologies of particles are highly diverse.

Latin nouns, verbs, and adjectives are all open categories.
They are able to head constituents,
and so are correlatives (though correlatives can be listed in the grammar).
The preposition class is closed and is a part of the grammar,
just like conjunctions.
However, conjunctions are purely functional,
while certain prepositions may be argued to head attributive expressions:
though prepositions are often said to be markers of a periphrastic case system,
the semantics carried by certain Latin prepositions are too complicated for a case system.
This is also the case of adverbs:
some adverbs seem to be periphrastic markers of \acs{tame} categories
and therefore may be considered as a part of the grammar,
while others seem to carry ``real'' meanings.
\prettyref{fig:latin-word-class} is a visualization of the classification of Latin word classes.

\begin{theorybox}{Lexical and function classes}{word-class-classification}
    By words with ``real category labels'',
    I mean words that have``real'' meanings
    and serve as lexical heads of constituents
    (i.e. being surrounded by function words and dependents).
    Certain adverbs and prepositions have ``real category labels'',
    and they appear at the left side in \prettyref{fig:latin-word-class}.
    Prepositions can be enumerated and therefore are considered as a part of the grammar,
    so they are always at the lower side in \prettyref{fig:latin-word-class}.
    Other adverbs and prepositions are light in their semantic
    and are purely functional,
    so they appear in the southeast corner of \prettyref{fig:latin-word-class}.

    This is not the standard terminology. 
    Linguists use their own notion of \term{lexical class} and \term{function class}
    to cover what I say here. 
\end{theorybox}

    \centering
    \input{arrow-box/word-class.tex}
    \caption{Latin word classes}
    \label{fig:latin-word-class}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Articles (English \form{a} or \form{the}), 
despite prevalent in other Indo-European languages,
are missing in Latin.
This, together with the fact that Classical Sanskrit and Old Persian didn't have articles 
and the Slavic languages still don't,
is a strong indicator that \ac{pie} didn't have articles. 
Note that the fact that Latin lacks articles 
doesn't mean the determiner syntactic function doesn't exist:
there are evidences suggesting certain aspects of the behavior of Latin \acs{np}s 
are just like English \citep{giusti2014split}.

\section{Nouns}

The structure of nouns and their phrases is introduced in \prettyref{sec:np.noun}.
They are declined for case and number (\prettyref{sec:regular-noun-declension}),
and the features also spread to other nominals in the \acs{np} by agreement.
According to their meanings and ability to license \acs{np} dependents, 
Latin nouns can be classified into TODO 

\section{Verbs}\label{sec:pos.verb}

Classification parameters of the Latin verb include 
the conjugation class (\prettyref{sec:finite-paradigm}),
the syntactic and semantic argument structure
(\prettyref{sec:verb-phrase.verb-frame}), 
the event structure (TODO: Compatability with \acs{tame}),

\section{Pro-forms}

Pro-forms can be divided into pronouns and correlatives.
The former are discussed in \prettyref{sec:np.pronoun}.
The latter can be classified in \prettyref{tbl:correlatives};
the rows correspond to their immediate roles,
while the columns correspond to their meaning and/or 
relation with a more precedent in a higher position.

\chapter{Noun and noun phrase}\label{chap:np}

\section{The structure of noun}\label{sec:np.noun}

Latin nouns are declined for case and number,
which is agreed upon by other nominal words in the \acs{np}.
The structure of the Latin noun is just
the stem plus inflectional ending 
with the case and number categories fused into one suffix
(\prettyref{sec:regular-noun-declension}).
There are five declension classes in Latin.

Inside the stem we find a list of 

\section{Declension of regular nouns}\label{sec:regular-noun-declension}

\subsection{The paradigm}\label{sec:noun.paradigm.introduction}

There exists a discrepancy in recognizing the stem of a noun.
One approach is to find the common part 
of all case forms of one nominal lexeme;
thus \form{rosam} \translate{rose-\category{sg}.\category{acc}}
is analyzed as \form{ros-am}, 
with \form{ros-} being the stem.
\citet[\citepage{17}]{allen1903allen} documents the paradigms of all the five declension classes 
in this approach.
The full list of attested noun endings is \prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}.
The list is still not the full picture of Latin nominal inflection:
stem alternation is seen in the third declension
(\prettyref{sec:np.inflection.3}).

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Declension endings; Roman numerals are declension classes}
    \label{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}
    \centering
    \input{tables/declension-noun.tex}
\end{table}

\begin{infobox}{Frequent confusions when analyzing noun endings}{noun-ending-confusion}
    The ending sequence \form{-io} can'be be found in \prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}
    and we may hurry to the conclusion 
    that it's the third declension abstract noun ending \form{-io} 
    in the nominative or accusative case.
    Not necessarily -- 
    it can also be \form{-ium} in the dative or ablative case 
    (when the macron symbol for long vowels are not used).
\end{infobox}

Another approach -- informed by historical comparison with other Indo-European languages -- 
make use of the thematic vowel 
in declension endings that can also be found in
\prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}
\citep[\citepages{45, 63}]{oniga2014latin}.
Thus, the first conjugation singular accusative ending \form{-am} 
is \form{-a-m}, 
with \form{-a-} being the thematic vowel;
we may also attach the thematic vowel back to the stem in the narrow sense \form{ros-} 
and redefine the complex \form{ros-a-} as the stem of \form{rosam}.
The table is shown 

\subsection{The third declension}\label{sec:np.inflection.3}

The third declension is a big tent containing several subclasses.
Nominative singular endings attested in the third declension
include \form{-s}, \form{-t}, \form{-x} (i.e. \form{-cs}) \citep[\citesec{53}]{allen1903allen}.

\section{The structure of the noun phrase}

Although Latin lacks the article 

\subsection{Attributives}

This section only discusses adjective or numeral attributives in detail.
For in-depth discussion of relative clauses, see \prettyref{chap:relative-clause}.


\subsection{The possessive construction}

\subsection{Numerals in the noun phrase}

\section{Minor categories}

Some \acs{np}s contain only one word and can't accept any modification or complementation.
They are also referred to instances of pronouns.

\subsection{Personal pronouns}\label{sec:np.pronoun}

Latin pronouns are complete \acs{np} themselves:
no attributives should be attached to them. 
Pronouns are declined for case, gender and number,
and they also can be governed by prepositions.

\subsection{Reflexive pronouns}

It can be seen that \form{se} lacks nominative forms.
In some circumstances, 
the reflexive \form{se} looks like the subject;
but these cases are more appropriately analyzed 
as reflexive usages of transitive verbs
(\ref{ex:np.minor.reflexive.1}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:np.minor.reflexive.1} \gll \dots necessarium est primo investigare de ipsa sacra doctrina, 
    qualis sit, et ad quae [se extendat]  \\
    \\
    \glt \translate{It is necessary to first investigate into this sacred doctrine, 
    of what kind it would be, 
    and what it would extend itself to (i.e. its nature and extent).} (\literature{Summa}, I q. 1 pr.)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Demonstratives}

Latin has proximate, medial, and distal demonstratives:
the first refers to something close to the speaker, 
the last refers to something far away,
and the second refers to something in between,
probably near the listener.

\subsection{Interrogative and relative pronouns}



\section{Case and preposition}

After discussing the internal structure of \acs{np}s, 
we investigate the interaction of \acs{np}s 
with their syntactic functions.
This is done by two systems: 
the case system and the preposition system.


\subsection{Distribution of the cases}\label{sec:np.case-distribution}

The roles of the five cases are not symmetric.
Being nominative simply means being the subject in a finite clause or something agreeing to it 
and nothing else: 
the subject may be in a passive clause and is not agentive at all.
The nominative case and the accusative case received by the direct object 
are \emph{structural} cases: 
they are purely decided by the syntactic environment 
and don't have much semantic significance.

On the other hand, the rest cases are \emph{inherent} cases:
they are similar to prepositions, having direct semantic interpretations
-- ``source'' or ``target'' or \dots -- themselves,
and once an inherent case is assigned to an \acs{np},
the latter is ``sealed'' just like a prepositional phrase:
the change of the outside syntactic environment 
doesn't change anything inside.

\subsubsection{The nominative}

\subsubsection{The accusative}\label{sec:accusative-distribution}

The accusative case has both structural and inherent uses
\citep[\citepage{238}]{oniga2014latin}: 

\subsubsection{The genitive}\label{sec:genitive-distribution}

Although in most teaching materials, the genitive case is considered 
to mark the possessor (and is thus an inherent case), 
a complete overview of its distribution reveals that 
it's actually a structural case 
representing \emph{any} type of nominal dependency 
and not just possession 
and also sometimes assigned by certain types of verbs;
some of the nominal dependencies can be 
metaphorically understood as possession, 
but others can't \citep[\citepage{244}]{oniga2014latin}:
it's hard to explain genitive of quality 
in terms of possession.
This is comparable to English \form{of}
in \form{a man of great talent} and \form{it's so kind of you},
which seems to be a purely structural phenomenon
and is not based on metaphor;
and indeed what is considered as prototypical possession 
also has strong cross-linguistic variation 
\citep[\citepages{262-263}]{dixon2010basic2}.

\subsubsection{The dative}\label{sec:dative-distribution}

The dative case is an inherent case assigned to the benefactive, the experiencer, and the purpose
\citep[\citepage{251}]{oniga2014latin};
thus it's the case assigned to the indirect object (\prettyref{sec:vp.complement.indirect-object})
as well as many adjuncts TODO

\subsubsection{The ablative}

The ablative case is an inherent case assigned to 
the source and the instrument;
so its distribution is similar to the dative case: 
it appears in source and instrument indirect objects (TODO) 
as well as various adjuncts.
A source argument
can be the position from which something moves 
(\concept{ablative of source})
or the source in a separation event 
(\concept{ablative of separation}: \translate{remove}, \translate{deprive}),
or the place where something comes into being 
(\concept{ablative of material}, \translate{birth}, \translate{origin}), 
or the cause of something (``the source of the event'', \concept{ablative of cause});
the agent in the passive voice possibly 
comes from one of the figurative use of the ablative as well.

\subsection{Prepositions}

\section{Constituent order and information structure}

Similar to the case in clause structure (\prettyref{sec:clause.order}),
the internal constituent order of \acs{np}s are strongly influenced by 
information structure.
The default constituent order is attributive-before-head noun
\citep[\citepage{396}]{allen1903allen}.

\chapter{Adjectives and adverbs}

The adjective class and the adverb class are linked together by several factors:
the adjective phrase and the adverb phrase are both prototypical modifiers,
often with parallel structures;
they both have the category of degree; 
adverbs can be formed regularly from adjectives.

\section{Declension of regular adjectives}

Peripheral arguments may also be regarded as adverbials.
This chapter, however, is mainly about mean, TODO

\section{The structure of the paradigm}

\subsection{The verb template of the finite paradigm}\label{sec:verb.finite.paradigm}

Some inflected Latin verbs and their parts are shown in \prettyref{fig:latin-verb}.
Traditionally, the verb is divided 
into the \concept{stem} and the \concept{ending}.
Derivation in Latin is predominantly preverbal,
and hence the conjugation is mostly about the final lexical morpheme in the verb stem,
which is represented as the root in \prettyref{fig:latin-verb}.
There may be a perfect suffix after the root.
Components of the verb ending include 
the \concept{tense and mood suffix} (also known as the \concept{tense suffix}),
and the person, number and voice marker,
which is called the \concept{personal ending} here, 
following the terminology in \citet[\citesec{165}]{allen1903allen}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \input{tables/verb-template.tex}
    \caption{The template of Latin verbs.
    Indentation means linear order and not necessarily constituency structure.}
    \label{fig:latin-verb}
\end{figure}

The core stem assumes semi-regular alternations.
The perfect marker is often but not always \form{-v-} (\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.stem.perfect}).
Although the aspect marker is a part of the \acs{tam} marking
(\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.finite-template.tame}),
it somehow is much more closely attached to the root 
in the morphophonological realization of the verbal system:
how it is realized is not completely predictable,
and therefore the two finite stem forms -- 
the present stem and the perfect stem -- 
are both required for complete characterization of the paradigm of a regular verb.
To fully decide the paradigm 
we still need a further stem, the supine stem
(\prettyref{sec:three-latin-stem}).

Contextual allomorphs also exist for other morphemes in \prettyref{fig:latin-verb}
\citep[\citepage{11}]{embick2005status},
as can be observed in \prettyref{tbl:latin-finite-verbs}.
The most salient change is that 
an alternating vowel may appear between the root and the aspect suffix (if any),
which is also known as the \concept{thematic vowel}.
It is the residue of the \ac{pie} ablaut
and labels the conjugation class
(\prettyref{sec:verb-morphology.stem.conjugation}),
and is subject to morphophonological contextual alternation
(\prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking}).
The tense affix is determined by ``tense'' in the sense of traditional Latin grammar, 
i.e. both tense and aspect (\prettyref{tbl:tense-suffix}),
and has dependence on the conjugation class (TODO: ref).
The \category{perfect} tense also has its own personal endings (\prettyref{tbl:personal-ending-perfect}).

\begin{infobox}{More than one thematic vowel?}{thematic-vowel}
    Phenomena similar to the thematic vowel -- vowel alternation with no morphosyntactic significance 
    between two morphemes -- can be observed 
    between the tense suffix and the personal ending 
    (as in \form{am\={a}b\textbf{u}ntur}; \prettyref{sec:verb-morphology.1c}) as well.
    We may go further and say that
    the \form{-imus} ending seen in first person active indicative perfect,
    as opposed to \form{-mus} observed in other cases, 
    contains a thematic vowel \form{i} after the perfect marker \form{-v-}.
    Some generalize the concept of thematic vowel and 
    stipulate a thematic vowel position after \emph{every} morpheme
    \cite{embick2003latin}.
    This is also motivated by evidences from some descendants of Latin 
    \citep{oltra1999notion,oltra2005stress}.
    Whether this is needed for describing Latin however is

    \label{tbl:latin-finite-verbs}
    \input{tables/verb-examples.tex}    
\end{sidewaystable}

Below I discuss the subsystems in \prettyref{fig:latin-verb}.

\subsection{Voice}

Latin doesn't have rich valency changing devices:
there is only one clause-wide valency decreasing device -- passivization -- 
and there is no valency increasing device.
Causative constructions are realized by complement clauses,
not any change in the argument structure.
A verb (and hence the clause headed by it) is therefore either in \concept{active voice},
or in \concept{passive voice}.
Some verbs are deponent (\prettyref{sec:deponent-verbs}),
which means they only have morphological passive forms.

\subsection{\acs{tame} categories}\label{sec:verb-inflection.finite-template.tame}

The categories of primary tense (past or not; future or not),
secondary tense (perfect tense -- or aspect -- or not),
imperfective-perfective distinction 
and realis-irrealis distinction 
are marked by the Latin tense and mood suffix in \prettyref{fig:latin-verb}.
The parameter of primary tense has three values: 
present, past and future;
the past future tense seen in English 
is absent in Latin.
The imperfective-perfective distinction and the secondary tense 
are fused into one category,
with three possible values: 
plain, imperfect, and perfect. 
The ``progressive perfect'' category (\form{have being doing} in English)
is missing in Latin.
TODO: Some say the imperfective/perfective distinction 
(for example the \form{be doing} construction in English)
is not syntactically coded in Latin?
What's perfect, then?
The realis-irrealis distinction is discussed below as \emph{mood}.

The composition of present, past and future tenses
and plain, imperfect and perfect ``aspects''
gives nine options,
but in Latin, 
the past simple and the present perfect are identified with each other,
for obvious semantic closeness;
the imperfect and simple ``aspects'' are fused 
when the primary tense is present or future.
Thus there are only six morphologically distinguished options,
as is shown in \prettyref{tbl:latin-tense-aspect}. 
In the Latin grammatical tradition, 
the term \concept{tense} 
usually refers to these six options,
instead of the past/present/future system.


\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Latin tenses}
    \label{tbl:latin-tense-aspect}
    \centering
    \input{tables/tense-aspect.tex}    
\end{table}

\begin{infobox}{Mismathc between \ac{tame} constructions and fine-grained categories}{tame}
    Note that semantic \ac{tame} features are different from 
    syntactic \ac{tame} features,
    and the two are in turn different from packaged \ac{tame} marking constructions
    that can be easily identified in surface-orientated analyses.
    This is illustrated in \prettyref{tbl:latin-tense-aspect}.
    Following the example in \citet{grimm2021grammar},
    in this note, I use small capitals for the names of attested surface realizations of \ac{tame}
    and the default font for \ac{tame} values.
    (Some other grammars, like \citet{jacques2021grammar,friesen2017grammar}, 
    use initial capitals for the former.)
\end{infobox}

Similar fusion between categories is shown in the category of \concept{mood}.%
\footnote{
    \citet{dixon2009basic1} only calls the category of clause type \term{mood}.
    \citet{cgel}, on the other hand, 
    calls syntactic modality mood 
    and uses the term \term{modality} for pure semantics.
    Different linguists use the term \term{mood} and \term{modality} in radically different ways.
    In this note I just focus on the common practice in Latin grammar study.
    In terms of general linguistics, 
    the Latin \term{mood} is a mixture of clause type (the real mood)
    and modality.
}
It's the fusion of morphologically marked clause type 
(declarative and imperative)
and morphologically marked modality.
The verb morphology of interrogative clauses is exactly the same as declarative clauses:
the interrogative clause type is marked by the existence of interrogative \term{pro}-forms.
Thus, there are three moods in finite clauses in Latin:
\acl{indicative}, \acl{subjunctive}, and \acl{imperative}.
The \acl{indicative} is the fusion of 
the declarative/interrogative clause type and the realis modality.
The \acl{subjunctive} mood is the fusion of 
the declarative/interrogative clause type and the irrealis modality.
The \acl{imperative} is basically the imperative clause type:
it doesn't allow modality marking.
Sometimes people say the infinitive is the fourth mood,
though it's a non-finite clause.


\subsection{Agreement}\label{sec:agreement-abs}

Latin is a typical nominative-accusative language,
both morphologically and syntactically.
In finite clauses, 
there is subject-verb agreement:
the number and person of the subject is marked on the main verb.
In the case of periphrastic conjugation,
the features are marked on the copula.

\subsection{Compatability of categories}

There is no \acl{future} tense and \acl{future perfect} tense in subjunctive clauses,
probably for the semantic reason
that the future tense already contains certain sense of modality
(an event predicted to happen),
and thus is not compatible with the \acl{subjunctive} mood.
The \acl{imperative} mood is not compatible with other \ac{tame} markings
except the \acl{present} tense and the \acl{future} tense.
It's still compatible with the voice category,
and allowed persons are 
second person singular/plural with the \acl{present} tense,
and second/third person singular/plural with the \acl{future} tense.
The absence of first person is also probably from semantic origin.

In conclusion, the categories involved in the finite verb paradigm of Latin 
are shown in \prettyref{fig:paradigm-finite-verb}.
Here mood and tense are realized in one morpheme,
and voice, person and number are realized in one morpheme.
The paradigm is realized synthetically in all circumstances 
except in passive voice and perfect tense.
In that case, the verb conjugation is realized like the English passive,
i.e. via a copula and the perfect passive participle.

\end{figure}

\begin{infobox}{Recording verb inflectional forms}{conjugation-form}
    
\end{infobox}

\subsection{The non-finite paradigm}\label{sec:non-finite-abs}

According to the morphology,
Latin non-finite verb forms can be classified into the infinitives (\prettyref{sec:infinitives})
and the nominal forms (\prettyref{sec:nominal-form}),
the latter having noun-like or adjective-like morphology.
Non-finite verb forms don't agree with the subjects they take,
so there is no number or person category marked on them in the same way as \prettyref{fig:paradigm-finite-verb},
though for nominal verb forms there are number and person categories 
marked in the same way as the nominal morphology.

The infinitives include present active, present passive, perfect active, 
perfect passive, future active, and future passive infinitives.
The latter three are realized periphrastically (\prettyref{fig:stem-to-form}).

The nominal verb forms include 
the \concept{simple active}, 
the \concept{perfect passive} (often just called the perfect participle), 
and the \concept{future active} participles,
the \concept{gerund}, 
the \concept{gerundive} which is also known as the \concept{future passive} participle, 
and two supine forms.
The \concept{first supine} is identical in the form to the singular neutral accusative perfect participle,
without any reference to the number category of any argument it takes.
The \concept{second supine} is identical to the singular neutral ablative or dative past participle,
also with no inflection with respect to the number category of any argument it takes.
The gerund is morphologically the singular neutral of the gerundive
(\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.non-finite.future-passive}).

\begin{infobox}{Whether to keep supine as a verb form}{supine-verb-form}
    The idea of the stingy linguist may lead one to reject the notion of supine in Latin grammar
    (\prettyref{sec:conjugation-form}).
    However, for the same reason the infinitive 
    (or the ``plain form'', since the infinitive is actually a label of clauses 
    -- see the discussion and the separation principle in \prettyref{sec:conjugation-form}) 
    is recognized as a form 
    independent from the present form in English in \citet[\citepage{74}]{cgel},
    the status of supine as a separate form is recognized in this note.
    The reasons include TODO
\end{infobox}

In Classical Latin, the gerund and participle forms are significantly more noun-like 
than their counterparts in English,
and this also justifies the term \term{nominal form},
because they are not far from prototypically nominalization:
although they are still modified by adverbs,
they are unable to take arguments.
In Ecclesiastical Latin, 
the so-called nominal forms are more verb-like (TODO: ref),
being able to take arguments,
and are therefore no longer ``nominal''.

\section{Formation of stems}\label{sec:verb-inflection.stem}

\subsection{The three verb stems}\label{sec:three-latin-stem}

Latin shows stem alternation that is not completely predictable.
All verb forms can be obtained by three stems \citep[\citesec{164}]{allen1903allen},
if the verb is regular:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \concept{present stem}, which, after attached with proper endings, forms
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \acl{present}, \acl{imperfect}, and future forms, 
        regardless of whether they are indicative or subjunctive,
        active or passive. (There is no future or future perfect subjunctive).
        \item All the imperatives.
        \item The present infinitives, active and passive.
        \item The present participle, the gerundive, and the gerund.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The \concept{perfect stem}, which, after attached with proper endings, forms 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect active, indicative or subjunctive.
        Again, there is no future or future perfect subjunctive.
        Note that the passives are \emph{not} formed by the perfect stem.
        \item The perfect active infinitive. 
        (Or the perfective infinitive active, since infinitive is considered as a mood by some people.)
    \end{itemize}
    Note that the perfect passive participle is \emph{not} obtained from the perfect stem.
    \item The \concept{supine stem}, 
    which, after attached with proper endings or used together with proper forms of \form{sum},
    forms 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The perfect passive participle, which, by being used with proper forms of \form{sum}, forms
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect passive forms, indicative or subjunctive.
            Again, there is no future or future perfect subjunctive.
            This is periphrastic conjugation: it is done by using proper forms of \form{sum}
            with the perfect passive participle.
            \item The perfect infinitive passive.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The future active participle, which, used together with \form{esse},
        makes the future active infinitive.
        \item The future passive infinitive, by being used together with \form{īrī}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This process is summarized in \prettyref{fig:stem-to-form}.

In a dictionary, 
typically the stems are not directly given 
-- which are given are representative verb forms,
from which the stems and the conjugation class can be inferred.
The reasons are the follows.
First, for fluent users,
recording actually attested word forms is easier
compared with the morpheme-based ``anatomized'' approach.
Second, Latin has four conjugation types,
and hence the three stems themselves aren't sufficient to decide how to conjugate the verb:
more information is needed, 
and by storing already conjugated verb forms,
the conjugation class can be decided by observing the endings.
What are stored are the following \concept{principal forms},
from which the three stems and the conjugation class can be solved out
\citep[\citesec{172}]{allen1903allen}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{The first-person present active indicative}: formed from the present stem.
    \item \emph{The present infinitive}: formed from the present stem. 
    By observing its ending, the conjugation class can be decided,
    and by comparing with the first principal form, 
    the present stem is obtained.
    \item \emph{The first-person perfect active indicative}: showing the perfect stem.
    \item \emph{The neutral accusative past participle}, i.e. the form of supine: showing the supine stem.
\end{enumerate}
The ways to obtain the stems from the principal forms are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{The present stem} can be found by dropping \form{-re} in the 
    \category{present infinitive}
    \citep[\citesec{175}]{allen1903allen}.
    \item \emph{The perfect stem} can be found from the third principal part:
    just remove \form{-ī}.
    \item \emph{The supine stem} can be found by dropping \form{-um} in the supine
    i.e. the fourth principal form
    \citep[\citesec{178}]{allen1903allen}.
\end{itemize}

Note that in Medieval Latin, often,
instead of \form{iri} plus the first supine,
\form{fore} plus the perfect participle is used to form the future passive infinitive.

\subsection{Formation of the present stem}


\subsection{Formation of the perfect stem}\label{sec:verb-inflection.stem.perfect}

\subsection{Conjugation classes}\label{sec:verb-morphology.stem.conjugation}

Depending on the way realization of the paradigm for a verb,
Latin verbs are traditionally divided into 
four conjugations classes
according to the thematic vowel of the stem:
if the stem ends in \form{a}, 
it's a first conjugation verb (\prettyref{sec:verb-morphology.1c});
if it ends in \form{e} 
then we have a second conjugation verb (\prettyref{sec:verb-morphology.2c});
TODO.
The conjugation classes however can't be reduced to 
the thematic vowel, 
since there are some contextual allomorphs that can't be explained synchronically
in this way
(\prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking}, \prettyref{tbl:tense-suffix}).
There are a handful of irregular verbs (\prettyref{sec:irregular-verbs})
that can't be inflected using rules pertaining to the four regular conjugations.

Another aspect of the inflectional behavior of the verb
is whether it's deponent;
this also has some implications on 
the argument structure (\prettyref{sec:deponent-verbs}).

\section{The finite paradigm}\label{sec:finite-paradigm}

Due to morphophonological rules, 
morpheme division inevitably involves controversies.
This section follows the analysis in \citet[\citechap{14}]{oniga2014latin}.

\subsection{Marking of tense and mood}\label{sec:tense-mood-marking}

The contextual alternation of the tense and mood marker is listed in
\prettyref{tbl:tense-suffix}.
They are subject to phonological rules 
and have allomorphs in different conjugation classes. 
A long vowel after the suffix,
if any, is shortened before \form{-m}, \form{-r}, \form{-t}, and \form{-nt}
due to vowel shortening in the final syllable before a consonant,
and also before \form{-ntur} due to Osthoff's Law 
(\prettyref{sec:phonology.rule.shortening}; 
\citealt[\citepage{130}]{oniga2014latin}).
The present indicative doesn't add a suffix after the stem, 
so the thematic vowel at the end of the stem 
is directly exposed to the personal ending,
and vowel changes in \prettyref{sec:phonology.morphological} happen.

The perfect and pluperfect subjunctive suffixes 
are only used for the active voice.
For the passive voice,
periphrastic conjugation with the perfect passive participle is used.

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Tense and mood suffixes}
    \label{tbl:tense-suffix}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Suffix & Mood and tense & Note \\
        \midrule
        $\emptyset$         & Present indicative        & With change on thematic vowel\\
        \form{-b\={a}-}, \form{-eb\={a}-}    & Imperfect indicative      & Possibly shortened \\
        \form{-be-}         & Future indicative         & For 1c, 2c; 
        Allomorphs: \form{-b-}, \form{-bi-}, \form{-bu-} \\

        \form{-e-} \\ 
        \form{-r\={e}-}     & Imperfect subjunctive     & Possibly shortened \\
        \midrule
        \form{-eri-}        & Perfect subjunctive       & For active only \\
        \form{-iss\={e}-}   & Pluperfect subjunctive    & For active only; possibly shortened  \\ \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{infobox}{Shortening or lengthening?}{shorten-or-prolong-ba}
    If we just restrict ourselves to the verbal paradigm, 
    it may be attempting as well to consider \form{-ba-} as 
    the indicative imperfect suffix,
    since \form{-b\={a}-} does not outnumber it.
    But prolonging is rare in phonology:
    shortening, due to physiological motion control factors
    (some sound sequences are easier to pronounce), 
    is more frequent.
    The same line of argumentation can be applied to justify the status of \form{-r\={e}-}
    as the somehow canonical subjunctive imperfect suffix.
\end{infobox}

Perfect indicative active verb forms have their own set of personal endings
(\prettyref{tbl:personal-ending-perfect}).
The plural part of the personal endings still contains 
the usual \form{-mus}, \form{-tis}, \form{-nt} endings, 
and thus alternatively, we may analyze the verb endings for the \category{perfect} tense 
as the follows: 
the tense suffix is \form{-ī-}
for first-person singular, third-person singular and first-person plural,
\form{-is-} for second-person singular and second-person plural,
and \form{-\={e}ru-} for third-person plural;
the first person singular ending is empty,
and the second person singular ending is \form{-tī},
and the rest of personal endings are the same as those of other tenses.

\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Personal endings for the \category{perfect}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Future: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For first and second conjugation verbs, 
            the tense-mood morpheme is \form{-bi-}, except for 
            first-person singular (which is \form{-b-})
            and third-person plural (which is \form{-bu-}).
            \item For third and fourth conjugation verbs, change stem-final stem.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Future perfect: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \form{-eri-} for all cases except first person singular.
            \item \form{-er-} for first-person singular.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item The subjunctive:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Present: no suffixation, but there is regular change on the stem-final vowel:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For first conjugation verbs, .
            \item For second conjugation verbs, \form{} $\to$ \form{e\={a}-}.
            \item For third conjugation verbs, $\to$ \form{\={a}-}.
            \item For fourth conjugation verbs, $\to$ \form{i\={a}-}.
        \end{itemize}
        These alternations apply for both active and passive verbs,
        so they have nothing to do with polarity, and this is why I put them in this section.
        \item Imperfect: \form{-r\={e}-}, possibly shortened.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The personal ending}

Possible personal endings are listed in \prettyref{tbl:personal-ending}.
In the active voice, 
\form{-\={o}} is used with present indicative, 
future indicative (first and second conjugations only), 
future perfect indicative,
and \form{-m} is used with imperfect indicative, 
future indicative (third and fourth conjugations only),
pluperfect indicative,
and the subjunctive mood regardless of tense.
The \category{perfect} tense has its own personal endings:
in the alternative analysis outlined in the last section,
the first person perfect indicative ends with \form{-ī},
and the second person perfect indicative ends with \form{-tī}.

The ending \form{-re} is alternative form of second-person singular compatible 
with all non-periphrastic tenses and moods.
If this personal ending is used, then the tense and mood marking is none.
Note that the resulting verb form is the same as the infinitive principal part
(\prettyref{sec:three-latin-stem}).

The \form{-or} version of the passive first person ending 
is seen in present indicative and future indicative
in the first and second conjugations;
the latter has the deep form \form{-be-or},
then then is realized as \form{-bor} because of vowel deletion 
(\prettyref{sec:phonology.rule.deletion}).

\subsection{The first conjugation}\label{sec:verb-morphology.1c}

Attested thematic vowel alternations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In first person singular present forms, 
    the final \form{\={a}} is dropped, 
    because the personal ending is \form{-\={o}} or \form{-or}
    and the thematic vowel is subject to vowel deletion.
    \item In active subjunctive  \form{\={a}-} $\to$ \form{\={e}-}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The second conjugation}\label{sec:verb-morphology.2c}

Attested thematic vowel alternations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In active indicative present forms, \form{\={e}} $\to$ \form{e}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The third conjugation}

The third conjugation has two subclasses:
the thematic vowel-less case, 
and the \form{i}-thematic case.

\subsection{Periphrastic conjugations}

An auxiliary verb construction is a structure 
that contains one or more auxiliaries apart from the main verb, 
and yet is mono-clausal and is not a complement clause construction,
and the auxiliaries are realizations of the verbal system 
surrounding the main verb, and not independent lexical verbs.
Auxiliary verb constructions realizing grammatical categories 
that are usually realized by inflectional endings in a paradigm
should be seen as a part of that paradigm,
and therefore are known as periphrastic conjugations.

\section{Non-finite forms}

\subsection{The infinitives}\label{sec:infinitives}

\subsection{The gerund and participles}\label{sec:nominal-form}

\subsubsection{The gerund}\label{sec:gerund-morphology}

The gerund is morphologically a neutral singular noun.
The stem is formed by 
adding \form{-nd-} to the present stem;
in other words, 
the accusative form of the gerund of the verb 
is obtained by removing the final \form{s} 
of the present active participle 
and adding \form{dum}.
Note that the nominative case is missing -- 
when a non-finite clause is required in the subject position,
it's always an infinitive.

\subsubsection{The present active participle}

The present active participle (i.e. the present participle) 
is morphologically a third declension adjective (TODO: gender).
The stem of the present active participle 
is obtained by adding \form{-nt} to the present stem.
Equivalently, the nominative singular form -- the citation form --
is obtained by replace the \form{-re} ending of the present active infinitive by \form{-ns}
(or in other words, add \form{-ns} to the present stem).

\subsubsection{The perfect passive participle}

The perfect passive participle (i.e. the perfect participle or the past participle)
can be found by declining the neutral accusative past participle, 
i.e. the fourth principal part.

\subsubsection{The future active participle}

To get the future active participle (i.e. the future participle), add \form{-turus} to the supine stem.

\subsubsection{The future passive participle}\label{sec:verb-inflection.non-finite.future-passive}

The future passive participle, 
or in other words the gerundive,
can be obtained by declining the gerund 
as if it's an adjective (TODO: declension class);
in other words the gerund is morphologically the singular neutral of the gerundive.

\section{Deponent verbs}\label{sec:deponent-verbs}

\concept{Deponent verbs} are verbs that are in the passive voice realizationally,
either with the corresponding morphological marking (\ref{ex:verb-morphology.deponnet.2})
or periphrastic marking (\ref{ex:verb-morphology.deponent.1}),
but still have active meaning.
An observed tendency is that 
so-called ``unaccusative'' verbs
seem to be deponent verbs in Latin,
which means the passive voice essentially is the 
``non-agentive'' voice (\prettyref{sec:verb-phrase.arguments.compatibility}).

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:verb-morphology.deponnet.2} \gll 
    [Confiteor] unum baptisma in remissionem peccatorum \dots \\
    confess-\category{ind}.\category{pres}.\category{pass}.\category{1sg}
    one-\category{sg.acc} baptism-\category{sg.acc}
    into/towards/about remission-\category{sg.acc}
    sin-\category{pl.gen} \\
    \glt{\translate{I confess one baptism for the remission of sins \dots} (Nicene Creed)}
    
    \ex\label{ex:verb-morphology.deponent.1} \gll \dots {} qui [locutus est] per prophetas \dots \\
    {} who speek.\category{aprt}-\category{sg.nom} 
    \category{be}.\category{ind}.\category{pres}.\category{act}.\category{3sg}
    through prophet-\category{pl.acc} \\
    \glt{\translate{\dots who has spoken through the prophets \dots} (Nicene Creed)}
\end{exe}

\section{Irregular verbs}\label{sec:irregular-verbs}

\subsection{The verb \form{sum}}\label{sec:sum-morphology}

\subsubsection{Overview}

The verb \form{sum} has lots of uses in Latin grammar (\prettyref{sec:sum}),
and its inflection is (unfortunately but expectedly) highly irregular.
It's also defective: 
it has no passive forms, either finite or nonfinite.
The principal parts (\prettyref{sec:three-latin-stem}) are 
\form{sum}, \form{esse}, \form{fuī}, 
with the supine form being absent -- usually replaced by the future active participle \form{futūrus}.

From the principal parts, 
we find the perfect stem is \form{fu-}, 
and the supine stem -- if we insist on defining it -- 
is the same, 
although the perfect passive participle is absent and so is the supine,
and therefore the supine stem only appears in the future active participle.

The present stem is not well-defined:
the second principal form \form{esse}
doesn't have the regular infinitive ending \form{-re},
though we can roughly recognize something like \form{es-} or \form{e-};
the first principal form \form{sum} gives \form{su-} or \form{s-}.
The two stems appear in the finite paradigm in an unpredictable manner, 
also with irregular though still recognizable endings.
Besides \form{s-} and \form{es-},
there is also \form{fo-} seen in one variant of the future active infinitive
(\prettyref{sec:verb-inflection.irregular.sum.nonfinite}),
which also appears in variants in
the subjunctive active imperfect part of the finite paradigm.

\subsubsection{The nonfinite paradigm}\label{sec:verb-inflection.irregular.sum.nonfinite}

The only nominal form is the future active participle \form{futūrus}.
The three active infinitives forms are all attested.
The present active infinitive is \form{esse}.
The perfect active infinitive is \form{fuisse}, 
regularly formed by the perfect stem \form{fu-}.

The future active infinitive can be regularly formed by adding \form{esse} 
to the future active participle,
and therefore is \form{futūrum esse}.
There is also a free variant \form{fore}.

\subsubsection{The perfect system}

The perfect forms -- finite forms and the perfect active infinitive -- 
of \form{sum} can be formed regularly (\prettyref{sec:finite-paradigm})
according to the perfect stem \form{fu-}.

\subsubsection{The imperative system}

The present imperative system, 
which is known for reflecting the present stem,
is formed regularly using \form{es-}:
the singular second person present imperative is \form{es}
and the plural second person present imperative is \form{este}.

\subsubsection{The present system}

The imperfect forms of \form{sum} are highly irregular,
though patterns can still be found.
In the indicative part (\prettyref{tbl:indicative-sum}): 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \category{present} forms show no pattern
    except the personal endings.
    Note that here \form{-m} instead of \form{-\={o}}
    is used for the first person singular form.
    \item The \category{imperfect} forms are formed 
    by adding the standard personal endings 
    (\form{-m}, \form{-s}, \form{-t}, 
    \form{-mus}, \form{-tis}, \form{-nt})
    to \form{er\={a}},
    the vowel \form{\={a}} of which 
    undergoes shortening according to rules in \prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking}.
    \item The \category{future} forms are formed by 
    the same personal endings seen in the first and the second conjugations,
    although the tense marker isn't the same: 
    the stem-tense marker complex is \form{er-}
    instead of the stem plus \form{-b-}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{The indicative paradigm of \form{sum}}
    \label{tbl:indicative-sum}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \category{present} & \category{imperfect}  & \category{future}  \\
    \midrule
    \form{sum}     & \form{eram}       & \form{er\={o}} \\
    \form{es}      & \form{er\={a}s}   & \form{eris}    \\
    \form{est}     & \form{erat}       & \form{erit}    \\
    \form{sumus}   & \form{er\={a}mus} & \form{erimus}  \\
    \form{estis}   & \form{er\={a}tis} & \form{eritis}  \\
    \form{sunt}    & \form{erant}      & \form{erunt}   \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In the subjunctive paradigm (\prettyref{tbl:subjunctive-sum}),
we find that in the \category{present} system, 
the stem-tense marker complex is fused into \form{sī-},
and in the \category{imperfect} system,
the stem-tense marker complex is fused into \form{ess\={e}-} or \form{for\={e}-},
both of which are then attached to the standard \form{-m}, \form{-s}, etc. 
personal endings, 
and the vowel shortening rule in \prettyref{sec:tense-mood-marking} works.

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{The subjunctive paradigm of \form{sum}}

    \label{tbl:subjunctive-sum}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule

    \form{sim}       & \form{essem}, \form{forem}       \\
    \form{sīs}   & \form{ess\={e}s}, \form{for\={e}s}   \\
    \form{sit}       & \form{esset}, \form{foret}       \\
    \form{sīmus} & \form{ess\={e}mus}, \form{for\={e}mus} \\
    \form{sītis} & \form{ess\={e}tis}, \form{for\={e}tis} \\
    \form{sint}      & \form{essent}, \form{forent}     \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{The verb \form{faci\={o}}}

The verb \form{faci\={o}} looks pretty regular
regarding the endings, 
except for one thing: 
its \emph{stem} alternates according to the voice.

\section{Auxiliary verb constructions}

Latin is usually perceived as a language with few analytic properties;
the only example of periphrastic conjugation 
being the \form{sum} plus perfect passive participate construction.
A deeper look however reveals 
there might be more 

\chapter{Verb phrase}

This chapter gives an overview of clausal dependents,
especially about the mapping from purely semantic argument roles to clause dependent slots.
This chapter is mainly about verbs that don't take complement clauses as arguments.
The phenomena discussed in this chapter mostly apply to complement clause constructions as well,
but complement clause constructions have their own peculiarities 
(\prettyref{sec:complement-clause-construct-overview}).


\section{Argument positions and verb frames}\label{sec:core-argument-marking}

This section examines complement%
\footnote{
    In \citet{cgel} the term \term{complement} 
    means A-positions mentioned in \prettyref{sec:a-position}.
    Thus the subject, several kinds of objects,
    the copular complement (\cite{cgel} calls it \term{predicative complement}) are all complements,
    and they are labels implying several grammatical relations:
    the label \term{subject} roughly corresponding to ``SpecTP'' or ``what is in \vP{} 
    and receives the object case from a high light verb''.

    In traditional Latin grammar, however, \term{complement} means the copular complement. 
    This note follows the terminology used in most descriptive grammars,
    so use the term \term{copular complement} to refer to the \ac{cgel} \term{predicative complement}.
    Also, as is seen in \prettyref{sec:core-argument-marking}, 
    the term \term{complement-taking verb}, despite being confusing,
    is used to refer to a verb that take a complement clause 
    or something semantically equivalent to a complement clause
    as one of its arguments.
}
and adjunct positions in Latin clauses. 
Parameters used in the classification include 
their correspondence with semantic roles 
(agent, patient, source, etc.; 
\citealt[\citesec{4.2}]{cgel}),
their internal structures (case, preposition, \acs{np} or clause, etc.), 
agreement, and
their behaviors in valency alternation.

Similar to other nominative-accusative languages,
Latin core arguments are coded as subject, object(s),
and copular complements at the level of alignment.
They can be distinguished by the semantic roles,
case marking, possible contents, and transformational properties

Beside the subject, various types of objects, and copular complements,
there are more clause dependents
corresponding to less frequently seen semantic roles 
like purpose, direction, location, etc.
They may be licensed or even required by the verb 
(\concept{oblique argument}, 
corresponding to the E argument in \citet[\citepage{116}]{dixon2010basic2}),
or they may be modifying the whole clause and therefore are usually optional 
(\concept{peripheral argument}, or ``adjuncts'').
Besides clauses and \ac{np}s (with or without prepositions),
their categories also include \ac{advp}s,
a majority of the latter originating from case forms.

A clear complement-adjunct distinction 
-- telling peripheral arguments from core arguments or oblique arguments --
is hard to establish in Latin.
Latin peripheral arguments do not necessarily have prepositions.
Latin is highly free-ordered and therefore all clause dependents 
can leave their base positions.
Latin is also highly \term{pro}-drop,
and even uncontroversial core arguments can be omitted.
Oblique arguments are frequent in Latin,
as is the case in English 
(consider \form{run away from} or \form{get into}).
Thus criteria of category, position, and argument in \citet[\citesec{4.1.2}]{cgel} 
all fail to work.
Latin doesn't have systematic way to replace the core predicate (i.e. without adjuncts) by an anaphora,
and that criterion does not work, either. TODO: really?
The remaining criteria are about selection, licensing, and obligatoriness;
these criteria are however hard to use for a classical language. 
Thus, despite I'm fully aware that  
clausal dependents concerning place, instrument, mean, etc. 
may be licensed by both the argument structure of the verb 
and by clausal adjunct positions 
and may have clear structural differences in other languages 
(as in English), 
currently no distinction between the two cases is made.


\subsection{The subject}

Latin is an accusative language.
A \concept{subject} can be identified for all clauses, 
though it is frequently omitted.
Grammatical behaviors of the subject are summarized in the follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coding of semantic role}: In an active clause, 
    the subject 
    is the S argument in a prototypical intransitive argument structure 
    and the A argument in a prototypical transitive argument structure.
    It's often said that the subject is usually the most agentive argument,
    but for so-called unaccusative intransitive verbs, 
    the subject is patientive,
    which can be demonstrated by the semantics 
    and the fact that when the causer of the event is present as an argument, 
    the patientive S argument in the intransitive verb frame
    becomes the O argument in the transition verb frame.
    In a passive clause, 
    the subject corresponds to the ``promoted argument'' (\prettyref{sec:passive}).  
    \item \emph{Case marking}: 
    Subjects are always nominative for finite clauses,
    whenever the case system is in action,
    i.e. whenever the subject is an \ac{np} or a gerund. 
    Nonfinite clauses may be argued to be subjectless in the surface form 
    (a reasonable claim, since they have deficient TP layers, 
    and hence it is possible that no canonical subject position exists),
    but in accusative-infinitive constructions, % TODO: control or ECM or ... ?
    the accusative may be seen as the non-canonical subject of the infinitive.
    \item \emph{Agreement}: 
    the number and person features on the subject leave marking on the verb complex.
    Latin does not have verbal agreement with arguments other than the agreement with the subject.
    \item \emph{Category}: a subject is an \ac{np}  
    or a complement clause (\prettyref{sec:complement-clause-construct-overview}), 
    usually an infinitive but never a gerund (\prettyref{sec:gerund-morphology}).
    This constraint isn't seen in any other clausal complement types.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The direct object}\label{sec:vp.complement.direct-object}

Here is a list of grammatical properties of the direct object:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coding of semantic role}: In a prototypical transitive argument structure, 
    the direct object is the P argument, i.e. the most patientive argument. 

    \item \emph{Case marking}: Direct objects are always accusative when it makes sense to talk about case -- 
    but not all accusative arguments are direct objects (\prettyref{sec:accusative-distribution}).
    \item \emph{Passivization}: If an argument is coded as the direct object, 
    then it can regularly be promoted to the subject position in a passive clause (\prettyref{sec:passive}). 
    Secondary objects are less frequently promoted in passivization (\prettyref{sec:accusative-distribution}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The indirect object and the secondary object}\label{sec:vp.complement.indirect-object}

Latin also has two complement positions named as object:
the indirect object and the secondary object.
The indirect object is distinguished by the following grammatical properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coding of semantic role}: in a AGT-type argument structure, 
    the indirect object is usually the G argument.
    Intransitive clauses sometimes also have indirect objects, 
    and an indirect object, in this case, is also a G argument.
    \item \emph{Case marking}: indirect objects are always dative
    (\prettyref{sec:dative-distribution}).
    \item \emph{Passivization}: indirect objects are always retained in passive clauses. 
    They are never promoted to subjects in passivization.
    % TODO: category
\end{itemize}

The secondary object is distinguished by the following grammatical properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coding of semantic role}: in an AGT-type argument structure
    that is always about information flowing,
    the T argument (i.e. the thing asked about or taught about) is the secondary object.
    The G argument (i.e. the person who is asked or taught) is the direct object.
    Sometimes the G argument is ablative, and in this case, 
    there is only one accusative argument: the secondary object.
    Another place where secondary objects appear is 
    clauses headed by a verb with a compounded accusative preposition. % TODO: SAO typology
    \item \emph{Case marking}: secondary objects are always accusative.
    \item \emph{Passivization}: secondary objects can be passivized, but much more rarely than direct objects.
    \item % TODO: category
\end{itemize}

The distributions of the secondary object and the indirect object 
are mutually exclusive.
This means for ditransitive verbs of type \classify{giving}, 
Latin shows a clear and strong tendency to identify the T argument with the monotransitive O,
while for ditransitive verbs about teaching,
the inverse is true.

\begin{infobox}{Comparison with English}{english-indirect-object}
    It can be found that the Latin indirect object has more similarity with the English \form{to}-PP,
    which is also called the indirect object in some grammars, but not \ac{cgel}.
    The Latin indirect object differs from the English (accusative) indirect object in passivization.
    Since in Latin, verbs with AGT-type argument structure do not have alternation of complementation pattern
    -- in English we have \form{give sth. to sb.} and \form{give sb. sth.}, 
    while in Latin there is only the former one, but \form{to sb.} is replaced by a dative,
    (always with no preposition) --
    the G argument is identified with the E argument,
    and the T argument is identified with the P argument.
    In other words, in Latin, there is only 
    the \form{John gave [goods]_{\text{T}} to [charity]_{\text{G}}} pattern:
    the double-object \form{John gave charity goods} pattern is absent.
    
    Therefore, for typical ditransitive verbs, i.e. verbs like \form{give}, 
    Latin shows a clear and strong tendency to identify the T argument with the monotransitive O,
    which is more typical than English%
    \footnote{
        In English, in the \form{give sb. sth.} construction, it is the person i.e. the G argument that is passivized,
        while the T argument i.e. \form{sth.} cannot, though the latter is identified with monotransitive O
        according to other criteria. 
    },
    but for verbs with meaning of \category{teach} or \category{ask},
    there is also a clear and strong tendency to identify the G argument with the monotransitive O.
    The term \term{secondary object} is coined to cover this grammatical position.
\end{infobox}

\subsection{Copular complements}

Latin also has copular complements.
A copular complement, just like its counterpart in English,
basically can be viewed as a displaced attributive or appositive 
(and hence is prototypically filled by an \ac{np} or an \acs{adjp})
but is a little more peripheral (manner, state, factitive, etc.) 
in its meaning than an attributive or appositive.

Latin has nominative predicate and accusative predicate:
as hinted by their names, 
the nominative predicate gives a property of the subject and agrees with it,
and the accusative predicate gives a property of the direct object and agrees with it.
In passivization of the direct object,
the accusative predicate becomes the nominative predicate.

Other types of copular complements without agreeing with the subject exist.
TODO: ablative of quality, price, etc. 
The syntactic status of copular complements here are closer to \acs{pp}s:
we may say they receive \emph{inherent cases},
while the nominative and accusative copular complements 
receive \emph{structural cases} 
(\prettyref{sec:np.case-distribution}).

\subsection{(Change of) location}

TODO: considering moving this section to the case section

Various semantic roles can be summarized as \category{source}, 
and the source clausal dependents -- adjunct or complement -- have the following properties.
Note that we are dealing with a \emph{group} of clausal dependents.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Coding of semantic role}: 
        
    \item \emph{Case marking}: a source argument is in the ablative case.
        It may come together with the prepositions \form{ex} or \form{ab}.
    \item \emph{Passivization}: not available.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Others}

There are other clausal dependents with semantic roles and case/preposition markings 
different from any other type mentioned above;
they are skipped here for brevity.
A full list of these clausal dependent slots can be found by checking the usage of each preposition.

\section{Preverbs and other verbal derivations}

\section{Verb frames}\label{sec:verb-phrase.verb-frame}

\subsection{Overview}\label{sec:verb-phrase.arguments.compatibility}

In this section I consider the correspondence between  
semantics of verbs and their syntactic properties.
Attested combinations of the argument slots include 

TODO: deponent, unaccusative

It can be seen that unaccusative verbs are all deponent
\citep[\citepages{308-309}]{oniga2014latin}

On the semantic side,
I follow the semantic classification by 
\citet[Part B]{dixon2005semantic},
\citet[\citesec{18.5}]{dixon2010basic2},
and \citet[\citesec{3.3}]{dixon2009basic1}.
Verbs are classified semantically into three subgroups:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Primary-A, which contains verbs that 
    don't take arguments with meanings similar to those of complement clauses,
    \item Primary-B, which are semantically \concept{complement-taking}%  
    \footnote{
        Here the term means ``semantically equivalent to a complement clause construction''.
    }
    and \concept{lexical},
    which have arguments that are semantically equivalent to complement clauses 
    (but not necessarily syntactically coded as complement clauses)
    and have meanings more complicated then what's expected for grammatical items, and 
    \item Secondary, members of which have the same \emph{meaning} 
    of certain grammatical constructions in the verbal system,
    but not the same syntactic properties
    (for example, they may just take complement clauses instead of being auxiliary verbs).
\end{enumerate}
Note that the valency class of the verb 
is strongly related to but is not determined by the semantics of the verb.


I will generally follow the classification in \citet[\citechap{4}]{Pinkster1};
some verb classes enumerated by Pinkster are discussed in more details 
in \prettyref{chap:complement-clause-construct},
since a full account of their behaviors is closely related to the structure of complement clauses.

In this case we get the possessive dative construction
\citep[\citesec{373}]{allen1903allen}.

\chapter{Clause structure}

The clause appears as a single utterance 
(and is a \concept{sentence} in this case),
either declarative or interrogative,
as a complement of a verb (complement clause construction),
as an adverbial of another clause
(i.e. modifier in the verbal system),
and as a relative clause 
(i.e. modifier in the nominal system).


\begin{infobox}{The term \term{sentence}}{sentence-name}
    Some authors use the term \term{sentence}
    as a synonym of \term{utterance}.
    This for some languages is not a good choice: 
    we may see that a clause as an utterance 
    contains more grammatical categories 
    (like sentence-final particles that are usually not seen in embedded clauses).
    This is not the case in Latin
    so the sentence-as-utterance terminology fortunately 
    doesn't create chaos.
\end{infobox}

Descriptive parameters of clausal structure include 
the availability and interpretation of \acs{tame} marking, 
the availability and interpretation of  
grammatical categories higher than \acs{tame} categories
including topicalization and focusing,
which essentially determine the constituent order, 
and, in the embedded clause case, 
the licensing environment
and the inside \form{wh}-forms.

\section{Finite declarative sentences: indicative and subjunctive}




\subsection{Constituent order and the information structure}\label{sec:clause.order}

Patterns in Latin constituent order are often overlook in traditional grammar.
Still, fine-grained constituency is demonstrated by 
the relation between \form{non} and the auxiliary 
(\prettyref{sec:constituent-order.aux-neg}),
radical change of VO/OV frequency when structural ambiguity is controlled
(\prettyref{sec:constituent-order.history}),
and usual constituency tests 
(\citealt[\citesec{1.6}]{danckaert2017development}; TODO: ref to my own analysis in conjunction).
The \form{non}-before-auxiliary condition implies 
a auxiliary hierarchy just like the one in English, 
although it's not as developed as the latter 
since Latin is inflectionally rich.
The constituency tests hint on 
at least the subject-\acs{vp} binary branching.
The fact that superficial VO/OV orders may have structural ambiguity 
means it's likely that some of the constituent orders 
are comparable to
English poetry in imitation of Latin \citep[\citesec{600}]{allen1903allen},
Japanese scrambling and topicalization (TODO: ref).

Available evidence supports the tradition in existing secondary literatures that
Latin is thus better described as a discourse-configurational language,
with multiple topicalization and focusing structures
(\citealt[\citepage{189}]{oniga2014latin}; 
\citealt[\citepage{77}]{danckaert2017development}; 
\citealt{devine2006latin}, among others).
Initial positions in clauses clearly bear information structure functions. 
Constituents that are able to move to the positions 
include almost everything: 
arguments, adverbials, the negator \form{non}, 
and also the verb (TODO: aux) 
\citep[\citesec{598}]{allen1903allen}. 
TODO: is it possible for the main verb to move to the initial point only?
Note that fronting of the verb may be used 
to focus the verb root or the \emph{tense}
\citep[\citepage{397}]{allen1903allen};
this means preposing of the verb is comparable to 
stressing the verb in English.

Apart from the information structure, 
prosody is also an important factor TODO

\begin{theorybox}{Semantics of topic and focus}{topic-focus-semantics}
    If an argument is not topicalized, 
    interpretation of it has a non-controversial overall picture: 
    \textit{v}' is interpreted as a $\lambda$-expression,
    and the semantic interpretation of the argument introduced by \textit{v}
    is then inserted into the slot in the $\lambda$-expression.
    For topicalized constituents, 
    people may want to propose a different interpretation mechanism;
    for example, if we want the interpretation of topic 
    to work in an ``online'' and ``greedy'' manner,
    we might stipulate that the interpretation of the topic $x$ 
    is something like $\lambda R . R(x)$,
    which takes the interpretation of the internal part of the sentence 
    as its argument.
    The main problem is this seems to conflate the interpretations of topic and focus:     
    the interpretation of a common focusing construction 
    \form{it was him that \dots}
    clearly is $\lambda R . R(\text{him})$, 
    where $R$ is to be filled by the meaning of the rest of the clause.
    So it's a good idea to treat topics like arguments
    and assume the Topic functional head just reminds the listener 
    to retrieve some past memories to set up an appropriate conversational context, 
    while the meaning of the Focus functional head 
    is likely to be a type shifter: 
    it first takes one argument -- the focus -- 
    and then turn the second argument -- the internal part of the clause -- 
    from, say, a $e \to e \to t$ predicate to a $e \to t$ predicate 
    \citep[\citepages{90-91}]{devine2006latin}. 
    Although the two are still logically equivalent (and they should),
    the fact that topicalization and focusing involve 
    different type signatures 
    makes it at least in principle possible 
    for the pragmatic module to 
    distinguish the two and 
    attach different pragmatic values to them.
\end{theorybox}

Pragmatically unmarked sentences have the arguments as pragmatic topics 
and the rest of the \acs{vp} are the focus:
\translate{we already know Baebius, his army, and Pinarius (topics);
the piece of new information is that 
a transferring process happens involving the three}.
This kind of sentences, known as ``broad scope focus'' sentences 
in \citet[\citepage{15}]{devine2006latin}
because the scope of focusing is broad
and not restricted to a single argument,
demonstrates a preferred constituent order 
\citep[\citepage{79}]{devine2006latin},
which may be referred as the \concept{neutral order} in Latin,
although its frequency -- without controlling the information structure -- 
isn't significant higher than other constituent orders.
This order clearly isn't a faithful representation 
of the argument structure, 
since the direct object -- the argument that is supposed to be the closest one to the main verb -- 
appears far from the main verb. 
The reason is likely to be that the ``neutral order'' also marks 
the aforementioned ``unmarked'' information structure, 
in which the arguments are by default topicalized 

In periphrastic conjugation,
the constituent order is subject + object + verb + \form{sum}.
This may also show a mismatch between the dependency structure and the linear order,
since if we consider the auxiliary \form{sum} to be 
the analytic counterpart of the inflectional suffix 
and has a higher position compared to the main verb (i.e. the participle),
then since the subject and topicalized constituents usually appear on the left side, 
it also should appear on the left side compared with the participle under it.
But the case may just be that the participle is focused and is moved leftward by default, 
just like the topicalized direct object,
so the auxiliary then appears at the end of the clause in the neutral order.

\subsection{Positioning of arguments}

\subsection{Positioning of the verb (without auxiliary)}

\begin{infobox}{Position of the verb}{verb-position}
    The position of the verb involves a theoretical question:
    is its appearance away from the unmarked clause-final position
    due to phrasal movement 
    (the verb root being moved to a new position, 
    carrying all suffixal realizations of 
    TP functional heads together with it),
    or is it due to being attracted by some sort of functional head
    (in this case the verb root is just like a head in head movement;
    similar mechanisms appear in, say, 
    \form{on the top of the mountain \emph{lies} a small village})?
    Since this distinction is hard to test, 
    I refrain from picking up one explanation.
\end{infobox}

\subsection{Positioning of auxiliary and negation}\label{sec:constituent-order.aux-neg}

One piece of evidence suggesting the grammatical status of \form{sum} 
is somehow different from a lexical verb 
is that its position has non-trivial interaction 
with the position of \form{non}.
The negator \form{non} usually appears before the verb 
(\citealt[\citesec{1.5}]{danckaert2017development}, TODO: or aux?),
and apparent violations seem to be constituent negation 
as opposed to sentential negation \citep[\citepage{43}]{danckaert2017development}.

\subsection{On so-called postposing constructions}

Whether postposing exists as an information structure marking device 
is still not completely clear. 
It's said that postposing is never used for emphasis \citep[\citepage{395}]{allen1903allen},
and apparent counterexamples are all ``afterthoughts'' TODO;
but 

The postponed subject is likely to be an afterthought, 
coindexed with a zero pronominal 
in the rest of the sentence before it
\citet[\citepage{87}]{devine2006latin},
comparable to English \form{it kills three people, the wandering puma}.

\subsection{Notes on some typologically rare constituent orders}


\subsection{Historical evolution}\label{sec:constituent-order.history}

Without sentences in which the OV/VO alternation 
can be alternatively analyzed as topicalization,
VO frequency no longer shows significant change as time went by,
indicating a well-defined extended verb phrase \citep[\citesec{1.5}, \citepage{29}]{danckaert2017development}.

\section{Information packaging constructions}

\subsection{Existential clause}\label{sec:clause.exist}

In the existential construction,
the \form{sum} verb always appears first
\citep[\citepage{396}]{allen1903allen}.

\subsection{Cleft construction}

nequitia est quae te non sinit esse senem

\section{Question formation}

\section{Small clauses}

Some constructions may be analyzed as ``small clauses'', 
which are smaller than usual clauses 
and lack real \acs{tame} marking;
they are therefore not ``real'' clauses, 
but still appear frequently in Latin texts.
(\ref{ex:clause.small-clause.1}) is a formula used frequently in Catholic Church 
and is an example of a small clause 
as a single and complete utterance.
The fact that \form{gratias} is not in the nominative or the vocative case 
means (\ref{ex:clause.small-clause.1}) is 
neither a finite construction nor a single-\acs{np} utterance.


\begin{exe}
    \ex \gll De-o grati-as \\
    God-\category{sg}.\category{dat} thank-\category{pl}.\category{acc} \\
    \glt \translate{(May) thanks be to God.}
    \label{ex:clause.small-clause.1}
\end{exe}

Since English -- and a lot of other languages -- 
bans small clauses appearing as complete utterances,
translation of these constructions may map them into full clauses in the target language. 

\begin{infobox}{Why small clauses}{small-clause}
    Alternatively, small clause constructions can be analyzed 
    as a full clause (for example, a copular clause) with the verb deleted.
    The main problem of this analysis is if this is true, 
    we need to explain why prototypical transitive clauses 
    never see their verbs omitted.
    It's therefore better to say 
    that a copular clause is a small clause \emph{plus} the copular,
    and that a giving or receiving ditransitive verb 
    takes a small clause as its internal complement,
    which doesn't involve a questionable verb deleting process
    and also captures the intuition that 
    a small clause is a full clause minus the verb.
\end{infobox}



\chapter{Adverbial clauses}



\chapter{Complement clause constructions}\label{chap:complement-clause-construct}

\section{Overview}\label{sec:complement-clause-construct-overview}

\subsection{Infinitives}

\subsubsection{\form{Accusativus cum infinitivo}, or the autonomous infinitive}

Despite the superficial resemblance to the English object raising constructions,
Latin complement infinitives with accusative subjects 
are licensed even after complete nominalization
of the complement-taking verb.
Therefore the accusative subject of the complement clause 
can't be seen as an object of the complement-taking verb, 
since the nominalized verb no longer takes object in Latin.
Therefore, the \form{accusativus cum infinitivo} construction 
is comparable to English \form{for sb. to do sth.},
where the subject of the complement clause is autonomous;
the accusative case here is the case assigned to 
the subject of an non-finite clause where the nominative case is not available.
This is not completely unexpected, 
since even absence of an explicit complementizer 
is observed in the \form{ut} clause as well
\citep[\citepages{290-292}]{oniga2014latin}.

\chapter{Relative constructions}\label{chap:relative-clause}

\section{Agreement properties}\label{sec:relative-clause.overview.agreement}

The case of a relative pronoun is determined 
by its syntactic position in the relative clause, 
and \emph{not} the case of the antecedent,
though the number and gender categories 
are determined by agreement with the antecedent.

\chapter{Coordination}

Latin coordination in the nominal system and the verbal system 
shows strong correspondence,
with most conjunction words being shared
by the two systems.


\chapter{Texts}

Below are some examples of Latin texts, 
in an order from the easiest to the hardest,
with remarks on their vocabulary and grammar. 

\section{Liturgy texts}

\subsection{Short formulae in the Roman Mass}

Examples in this section are short formulae found in the Roman Mass
in the order of their appearance.
In (\prettyref{ex:text.mass.1}, \prettyref{ex:text.mass.2}),
\form{nomine} and \form{patris} are third declension nouns, 
while \form{spiritus} is a fourth declension noun. 

\begin{exe}

\section{Vulgate bible}

\subsection{Excerpts in John 1}\label{sec:text.vulgate.john}

\begin{exe}
    \ex\label{ex:text.john.1.1} 
    \gll in principio erat Verbum et Verbum erat apud Deum et Deus erat Verbum \\
    in {} be.\acs{imperfect}  \\
    \glt \translate{In the beginning} (John 1:1)
    
    \ex\label{ex:text.john.1.3}
    \gll omnia per ipsum facta sunt 
    et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est \\
    all-\category{n}.\category{pl}.\category{nom} through \category{dem}-\category{acc}
    make.\category{pprt}-\category{n}.\category{pl}.\category{nom} 
    be.\category{ind}.\acs{present}.\category{3pl} 
    and without \category{dem}.\category{abl} 
    make.\category{pprt}-\category{n}.\category{sg}.\category{nom} 
    be.\category{ind}.\acs{present}.\category{3sg}
    nothing.\category{nom}
    \category{rel}.\category{n}.\category{3sg}
    make.\category{pprt}-\category{n}.\category{sg}.\category{nom} 
    be.\category{ind}.\acs{present}.\category{3sg} \\
    \glt \translate{All have been made through exactly this (i.e. the Word of Lord),
    and without exactly this, nothing that has been made has been made.} (John 1:3)
\end{exe}

As an example, 
below I show how
(\prettyref{ex:text.john.1.3}) can be parsed.
First we can see a \form{et} dividing the sentence into two branches.
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item For the first branch, 
        we know \form{omni-} is a quantifier meaning \form{all},
        and morphologically it's a twin-termination third declension adjective; 
        then from \prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}
        and the fact that we are dealing with a third declension word, 
        the ending \form{-a} means neutral and \category{pl}.\category{nom}/\category{acc}/\category{voc}. 
        The vocative case is of course impossible here. 
    \item The word \form{per} is a preposition taking an accusative object. 
        \form{Ipsum} is a basic identity demonstrative, 
        with the meaning of ``exactly this''. 
        Since it follows \form{per}, 
        the ending \form{-um} here seems to be the accusative case marker, 
        instead of a neutral nominative case marker. 
    \item The sequence \form{facta sunt} contains 
        the indicative perfect 3pl copula \form{sunt}, 
        and in \form{facta}, we see the supine stem \form{fact-} 
        of the verb \form{faci\={o}} \translate{make}. 
        The second fact means 
        \form{facta} should be the perfect passive participle in a certain inflection form.
        Then \form{facta sunt}, collectively, 
        is the indicative passive perfect 3pl form of \form{faci\={o}}.
        (Here we are fortunate: 
        it's possible that \form{facta} and \form{sunt} get scattered to different places.)
        The \form{-a} ending can again be looked up for in \prettyref{tbl:declension-ending-nouns-list}:
        the possibilities are \category{pl}.\category{nom}/\category{acc}/\category{voc} -- 
        note that the first declension singular possibilities 
        are excluded by the fact that \form{sunt} is in plural form. 
        We expect \form{facta} to be nominative 
        because it has to agree with the subject, which is always nominative 
        and it turns to be possible. 
        \item Now we should link things together. 
            The open ends are: 
            the case of \form{omnia}, 
            and the (3pl) subject of \form{facta sunt}.
            Then quite obviously, 
            we find \form{omnia} should be in the subject position, 
            and therefore everything works well. 
        \item We can also check gender agreements to make sure our reading is correct.
\end{enumerate}
The second half is done in similar manners. The structure of the text looks like this: 
\begin{exe}
    \sn {} [[omnia]_{\text{subject}} [per ipsum]_{\text{instrument:\acs{pp}}} [facta sunt]_{\text{verbal complex}}]_{\text{coord}} 
    et [[sine ipso]_{\text{adverbial:\acs{pp}}} [factum est]_{\text{verbal complex}} [nihil [quod factum est]_{\text{rel}}]_{\text{subject}}]_{\text{coord}}
\end{exe}

In (\prettyref{ex:text.aeneid.1.1}),
it should be noted that \form{arma} is in plural only.
The \form{qui} clause is an example of the rule 
that the relative pronoun doesn't agree in case 
with the antecedent (\prettyref{sec:relative-clause.overview.agreement}).
The copula is omitted in the \form{qui} clause.

\section{\literature{Summa Theologiae}}

\subsection{Introduction}

Thomas Aquinas, a theologian and philosopher, 
was recognized by the Catholic Church 
as one of the Doctors of the Church,
usually known as \form{Doctor Angelicus} 
(doctor-\category{sg.nom} angle-\category{adj}-\category{sg.nom}, 
\translate{Angelic Doctor}).
\literature{Summa Theologiae}
(summary-\category{sg.nom} theology-\category{sg.gen}, \translate{Summary of Theology}) 
or \literature{Summa Theologica} 
(summary-\category{sg.nom} theology-\category{adj}-\category{sg.nom.f}),
usually abbreviated as \literature{Summa},
is probably his most known work.
As its name implies, the book is a summary of Catholic theology,
containing necessary information for 
beginning theological students 
and for arguing against frequently seen heresies. 
Apart from its great value within and out of Christianity, 
the book is a good example of 
what Medieval Latin looks like.

One salient feature of \literature{Summa} is 
it's written in a rather strict and even dull format.
The work is divided into three Parts,
each containing many Questions.
Each Question (i.e. a topic, like ``the nature and extent of this sacred doctrine'') 
is divided into several Articles 
(i.e. a specific question, like whether the sacred doctrine is a science).
Each Article starts with a sentence like (\ref{ex:text.summa.intro.1}) indicating its index 
within the Question it belongs to,
and then several Objections are raised 
to support an unorthodox idea;
then the accepted doctrine contrary to the above heretical claims is given
(\ref{ex:text.summa.intro.2}),
followed by a comment by Thomas on this Article (\ref{ex:text.summa.intro.3}).
