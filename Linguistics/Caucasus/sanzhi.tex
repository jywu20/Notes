\chapter{Grammatical overview}




\paragraph*{Morphological typology}

\section{Parts of speech division}

\paragraph*{Wordhood}

\paragraph*{Recognizing the verb}
The morphological template of the verb
is shown in \citet[\citetable{11.9}]{forker2020grammar}.
The verb conjugates partly according to
gender (in the prefix chain), person and number 
(both in the suffix chain and in the prefix chain). 
Other clear inflectional categories include 
negation and the two TAM slots.
Verb derivation is not very active:
it seems it's impossible to have multiple rounds of compounding.

\section{Clausal syntax}

\subsection{Constituent orders and information structure}

\paragraph*{The predicator and clausal dependents} 
A clause is a predicator (which may be null) plus constituents around it.
The predicator is often informally known as the \emph{verb}, 
although the term is more frequently used to refer to a lexeme that is prototypically verb-like, 
which may be used as the predicator or not, 
and it's possible to have a clause headed by something else. 
Criteria used to recognize the verb are outlined above in TODO 

From a surface-based perspective, 
there is no hard constraint on the constituent order in the main clause;
the constituent order however reflects pragmatic information,
and the relation between the two is not as simple as 
``the most important constituent is fronted'',
but has some structural constraints -- TODO: citation.
This is similar to the case of Latin or many other so-called 
languages with free constituent orders.

\paragraph*{Neutral orders}
The neutral order is SOV or SV; SVO is also attested
\citep[\citetable{27.1}]{forker2020grammar}.
Temporal adverbials appear before the main verb in the SOV case 
\citep[\citepage{520}, (30)]{forker2020grammar}.
Object focusing is possible with the SOV and SVO orders
\citep[\citepages{520-521}]{forker2020grammar}, 
which is not surprising since object focalization agrees with the neutral information structure 
and either does not necessarily trigger explicit movement
or only works within the verb phrase and merely swaps the object with some adverbials, if any.
The alternation between the VO and OV orders: why? TODO

\paragraph*{Verb-second focalization}
The OVS order is induced by focusing both the object and the verb.
This order, when the object and the verb are focused, 
is not uncommon in other languages, particularly in verb-second constructions;
indeed in modern English we have focus constructions like 
\form{only then do we cook} 
where a focusing position is added before the nucleus clause 
to which the main verb is fronted and before which the focused constituent is placed
(although in modern English the focus category is not strong enough 
to attract the whole verb to the front).
Similar constructions are also attested cross-linguistically \citep[\citepage{521}]{forker2020grammar}.
Similarly when the subject is focused, SVO may appear, 
besides its appearance as a neutral order.
Thus the alternation between SVO and SOV is possibly although not necessarily 
the alternation between subject focalization and object focalization (plus subject topicalization).
TODO: the position of adverbs in focusing SVO and normal SVO

\paragraph*{Focalization of the verb only}
Focalization of the verb -- without focalization of anything else -- likely lead to the VSO order.
\citet[\citetable{27.1}]{forker2020grammar} says in this constituent order, 
the subject and the object are all topical; 
this may be a natural consequence of the verb and only the verb being focalized.

\paragraph*{Object topicalization}
The OSV word order is less common.
It seems to be formed by topicalizing the object \citep[\citepage{522}]{forker2020grammar}; 
the subject-plus-verb focalization reading is likely a derivation 
of the object topicalization reading.

\paragraph*{Rightward shift of the subject}
All pragmatics-driven word order alternations introduced so far are fronting operations: 
the verb-second focusing order, 
the fronting of the verb, and the fronting of the object.
When the subject is topicalized, an additional strategy is to place it \emph{after} the rest of the clause: 
hence we have the VS and the OVS orders where the subject is topicalized.
This looks like an ``afterthought'' construction that's 
not uncommon in languages with flexible word orders, 
like Latin \citep[\citepage{39}]{devine2006latin}.


TODO: presentational

\paragraph*{Omission of arguments} 
A final remark is uncontroversial core arguments in Sanzhi clauses can also be dropped 
if they can be recovered from the context.
This is different from valency alternation in that 
argument dropping in valency alternation creates a \emph{new} verb frame 
and hence may lead to slight meaning alternation as well:
the English sentence \form{the dog bites} means 
the dog is mean and has the bad habit to bite people he doesn't like; 
we never say \form{your dog bites} to refer to a \emph{specific} event 
in which the mean dog bites a guest.
On the other hand, in Sanzhi, the latter usage is totally find. TODO: citation 

\subsection{Alignment and grammatical relations} 

\paragraph*{Morphological ergativity}
Roughly speaking, Sanzhi shows morphological ergativity 
but syntactic accusativity \citep[\citesec{22.3}]{forker2020grammar}.
Ergativity can be observed in agreement and case marking, 
and this can be explained by assuming that 
the ergative case resembles an inherent case, 
not unlike the \form{by}-phrase in the English passive:
in this case the only argument that is visible to the verb 
is the absolutive argument.

Sanzhi has three agreement systems, 
namely pure number agreement, 
combined gender/number agreement, 
and person agreement \citep[\citepage{373}]{forker2020grammar}.
At the clause level all the three systems are present.
The systems are independent to each other, 
meaning that the controllers of the three agreement systems can be different.


Sanzhi deviates from the ideal morphological ergativity
in the following aspects.
First, it has quirky subject case marking: 
with affective verbs, subject-like argument may take the dative case 
\citep[\citetable{19.1}]{forker2020grammar}.
Second, agreement with arguments other than the absolutive argument
-- i.e. arguments in the ergative or dative cases --
is possible \citep[\citesec{20.2.4}]{forker2020grammar}.

\paragraph*{Person agreement}
Person agreement shows the distinction between speech act participants and third person.
The rules are discussed in \citep[\citesec{20.3.2}]{forker2020grammar}.

Person agreement, on the verb, is realized in the suffix chain
and is related to the realization TAM categories 
\citep[\citesec{11.4}]{forker2020grammar}.

\paragraph*{Gender agreement}

It's possible to have ``semantic agreement''
\citep[\citesec{20.2.2}]{forker2020grammar},
as in, say, fairy tales; 
we may say that there are actually two gender features in the 
noun phrases that trigger the person agreement:
the inner gender feature is the feature that comes with the head noun, 
while the outer gender feature is the feature 
added by the speaker around the noun phrase;
the gender marking of the head noun follows the inner gender feature, 
since the lexicon simply doesn't contain a concrete realization 
of a noun with the wrong gender feature;
but the gender feature visible to the verb 
is likely to be the outer gender feature. 

\paragraph*{Discrepancies between agreement systems} TODO: examples of different controllers

\paragraph*{Case marking} 
Case marking depends on the grammatical function of an argument, 
but also its deep semantic role: 
with affective verbs, subject-like argument may take the dative case 
\citep[\citetable{19.1}]{forker2020grammar}. 

\paragraph*{Syntactic pivot} 

\subsection{TAME categories} 

Here we list all TAME categories that can be easily recognized from surface-based evidence.

\begin{itemize}
    \item perfective, imperfective \citep[\citepage{206}]{forker2020grammar} \todo{Morphological, or real imperfective-perfective distinction?
    \citet[\citepage{259}]{forker2020grammar} mentioned ``imperfective aspect''}
    \item present, past: the present tense is marked by 
    person enclitics for first and second person, 
    and by the copula for third person \citep[\citepage{250}]{forker2020grammar},
    or maybe the \form{-ne} suffix \citep[\citepage{253}]{forker2020grammar};
    the past tense is marked by past enclitic \form{=de} \citep[\citepage{252}]{forker2020grammar}.
    \item The future meaning seems to be expressed by  
    the modal category: the first TAM slot in the verb is filled by 
    the modal participle marker \form{-an} \citep[\citepage{18.1.2.2}]{forker2020grammar};
    the person enclitics/third-person (tense?) marker \form{-ne} is added after it.
    The marker \form{-ne} indeed seems to be a tense marker: 
    it's in contrastive distribution with the present person marker,
    and it never appears in non-future constructions
    (in obligative constructions, third person is always marked by the copula).
    \todo{Relation between the future and the various obligative categories}
    \item Habitual or not, in the imperfective paradigm: 
    habitual present/past, where personal affixes are attached  
    directly after the stem \citep[\citepages{243, 246}]{forker2020grammar};
    compound present/past, the personal enclitics are attached 
    after the converb; 
    future, obligative, etc., where personal and tense suffixes are attached 
    after the modal participle \form{-an}. 
    (for obligative constructions we have another \form{-te} suffix after \form{-an},
    which retains its historical meaning -- definite denotation -- 
    in some cases \citep[\citepage{256}]{forker2020grammar}).
    \todo{Why the personal enclitic is recognized as a clitic.}
    \item In the perfective paradigm:
    simple: we also have ``perfective simple (not habitual) past'', 
    or, according to its morphological profile, the preterite 
    \citep[\citesec{14.2.2}]{forker2020grammar},
    but we don't have perfective simple present,
    although we do have imperfective preterite;
    imperfective and perfective resultative; 
    perfect, present and past, with \form{=da} etc. after the perfective converb; 
    experiential I and II, present and past. 
    \item For non-finite forms, the imperfective converb 
    is obtained by attaching the imperfective converb suffix \form{-ul(e)} to the imperfective stem
    \citep[\citepage{306}]{forker2020grammar},
    but the perfective converb is obtained by 
    attaching the perfective converb suffix \form{-le} to the preterite participle 
    \citep[\citepage{308}]{forker2020grammar}.
    The term \term{preterite} has morphological meaning only:
    it's usually known as a participle when used in a relative clause, 
    when it's used in finite conjugation, 
    it's simply referred to as the preterite in \citet{forker2020grammar}.
    \item Semi-auxiliary verb constructions (i.e. so-called \term{periphrastic verb forms})
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Summary of attested core TAM constructions}
\prettyref{tbl:core-tam} shows the core TAM constructions of Sanzhi;
constructions involving auxiliaries that also appear as lexical verbs, 
or what are known as \term{periphrastic verb forms} in \cite{forker2020grammar}
(on the other hand, the term \term{analytic verb forms}
is used for categories in \prettyref{tbl:core-tam} 
that involve non-finite verb forms in their morphological realizations),
are not displayed here.

\citet{forker2020grammar} doesn't mention whether there exists 
temporal adverbs that seem to be a part of the TAM system 
instead of temporal peripheral arguments comparable to location expressions; 
a search in the corpus however reveals that 
\form{hana} \translate{now} has a strong tendency to say either 
at the beginning or at the end of a clause; 
counterexamples exist 
\citep[\citepage{292}, 37, 40]{forker2020grammar}, 
which 

\subsection{Verb frames} Valency changing devices are not abundant in Sanzhi;
we only know an antipassive and a causative,
the former lacking any morphological marking on the verb 
\citep[\citesec{19.2.1}]{forker2020grammar}.



\subsection{Negation} 


\section{Noun and prepositional phrases}

\paragraph*{The template of noun phrase} A template of the noun phrase 
can be seen in \citet[\citesec{21.1.3}]{forker2020grammar}.

\section{What to investigate for lexical items}

\paragraph*{Nouns}

\subsection{Verbs}

\paragraph*{Verbal stems} The verbal stems of Sanzhi verbs have 
lexicalized, unpredictable imperfective/perfective alternation
\citep[\citesec{11.2}]{forker2020grammar}.
Some conjugational classes can still be recognized.
Also there are morphologically exceptional verbs 
\citep[\citesec{11.2.7}]{forker2020grammar}.


\chapter{Verb morphology}

The gender prefix is actually a portmanteau of 
gender, person and number \citep[\citetable{20.1}]{forker2020grammar}.

\begin{exe}
    \ex asdf \source{ab}
\end{exe}

Now we try to locate the aforementioned TAM features to morphemes, 
being fully aware that this is not always possible. 
The imperfective-perfective distinction is of course marked 
solely by stem alternation.
In the analytic verb forms, 
the simple and the resultative aspects
are marked by the preterite participle suffix, 
and distinction between the two is realized by the 
presence or absence of the copula; 
the generic aspect is marked by the converb suffix; 
the future and the obligative are marked by 
the modal participle suffix.

The distinction between the future and obligative categories is more subtle.
For first and second person, 
we have three morphological parameters:
whether there is a definite denotation \form{-te} clitic after the participle, 
whether what follows \form{-te} (if it's there) is 
the past tense \form{=de},
and if not, whether what follows \form{-te} is a personal clitic 
or the copula.
The appearance of the copula always leads to an obligative meaning:
now if there is no \form{-te}, 
we say we are in the obligative, 
otherwise we say we are in the obligative present. 
The copula seems incompatible with the past marker;
the past obligative meaning is expressed by -\category{dd}=\category{pst}
(see below).
On the other hand, obligative meaning can still be expressed 
without the copula:
the future (\category{ptcp}=\category{1/2}) has modal meaning, 
and so do the future in the past (\category{ptcp}=\category{pst}),
the obligative past (\category{ptcp}-\category{dd}=\category{pst}), 
and the obligative present without copula (\category{ptcp}-\category{dd}=\category{1/2}).
Among them, the obligative past has no ``past future'' meaning, 
while the rest three constructions all have both the future meaning 
and the obligative meaning.
Therefore it seems the \category{dd} suffix is free to appear and go 
in the present tense, 
but in the past tense, it enforces the obligative meaning.

In conclusion, we find that the obligative meaning is sometimes not realized at all 
and sometimes realized as using the copula for the first and second person,
and sometimes realized as \category{-dd}-\category{=pst}.
The \category{-dd} suffix otherwise has no is redundant and is free to come and go.
Now the meanings of all the three morphological parameters are clear.
