Reading note of Describing Morphosyntax by Thomas Payne

# Chapter 2

## 2.0

One benefit of the Word and Paradigm approach: each word form acts like an independent entity, which involves 
the context, rather than chunks of linguistic matter.

## 2.1

Quantitative definition of indices of synthesis and fusion are simply not useful in a grammar sketch.

Note that *fusion* has no direct relation to *regularity*. If a morphological process involves a suprasegmental 
morpheme (example: Nilotic languages), it is still fusional, though it's highly regular.
