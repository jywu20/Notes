# Topics in generative syntax and approaches to them 

## Agreement

Types of agreement:
- between verbs
- between a verb, or a tense/aspect/mood marker, and a nominal expression
- between a noun and its modifier
- negative concord
- binding theory maybe
- and much more...

Some possible approaches:
- "Timed bomb": hypothesis proposed by Chomsky that lexical items carry uninterpretable and unvalued features when taken out of the lexicon. Since all uninterpretable features should be checked and deleted before the sentence is handed to PF component, Agree operation is invoked to link a head and a constituency c-commanded by it and to value all uninterpretable features of both.
- Selectional property: if α and β agrees in feature aF, then one of them takes the other as one argument, and the former selects the respective argument with feature aF. Example: in English, a verb with 3sg suffix -s selects a 3sg subject.

## Adjunction

### Adjectives and nominal expressions

### Adverbs and verb phrases

### Relativization

Now we take a brief review of promotion analysis of restrictive relative clauses. The mechanism is illustrated as follows:

[D [<sub>CP</sub> NP<sub>m</sub> ... [<sub>TP</sub> [<del>D</del> t<sub>m</sub>]<sub>k</sub> [... t<sub>k</sub> ... ]]]]

First we have a verb phrase or adjective phrase, and then the nominal expression with subscript *k* is moved out to the subject position:

[<sub>TP</sub> [D NP<sub>m</sub>]<sub>k</sub> [... t<sub>k</sub> ... ]]

The determiner is deleted, and the NP is moved to the topic position of the CP (which is the relative clause).

[<sub>CP</sub> NP<sub>m</sub> ... [<sub>TP</sub> [<del>D</del> t<sub>m</sub>]<sub>k</sub> [... t<sub>k</sub> ... ]]]

The final procedure is to merge a determiner into the structure to form a nominal expression with relative construction.

Example:

[<sub>DP</sub> the [<sub>CP</sub> glass<sub>m</sub> that [<sub>TP</sub> [<del>D</del> <del>glass</del><sub>m</sub>]<sub>k</sub> [<del>the glass</del><sub>k</sub> is on the table]]]]

What about non-restrictive clauses?

## Reference
Anaphors include reflexives (i.e. self/selves forms like myself/yourself/themselves etc.) and reciprocals like each other and one another. Such anaphors have the property that they cannot be used to refer directly to an entity in the outside world, but rather must by bound by (i.e. take their reference from) an antecedent elsewhere in the same phrase or sentence.

## Clause structure

### Tough clause
It is tough to understand the book.

It is tough for me to understand the book.

For me it is tough to understand the book.

## Agreement

### Affix hopping, and other cliticization phenomena
John hasn't done this.

### Affix or prefix attaching

### Arguably suffix of negation
(If we consider words like "not" as **head** instead of **specifier** of NegOP)

### Polarity
At least one copy of a polarity item must be c-commanded by an affective constituent (for example a negative one).

Non-constituent puzzle: why non-constituent deletion is possible?

## Coordination

## Parenthesis
Bolt is - on this, we certainly agree - the fastest man in the world.

It is not mutually, I think, that ...

It is, however, the most prestigious ...

## Ellipsis
