# The comparative method

See chapter 5.

Working procedure:

1. Assemble cognates
   - Throwing away borrowed words
   - Throwing away false friends. For example, English *mess* has similar meaning to Kaqchikel *mes*,
   but we don't see any other correspondence between English *m* and Kaqchikel *m* 
   (note that if two languages are genetically related, words with unrelated meaning will also show 
   correspondence in their pronunciations)
   - Usually start with basic vocabulary, because it involves fewer borrowed words
2. Establish sound correspondences
   - Find possible correspondences, and check whether (and in which environment) they work
3. Reconstruct the proto-sound
   - Sound changes have directionality
   - Majority wins, but ...
     - It's possible that some sound changes are so common
     - It's possible that none of existing languages reflects the proto-sound
     - It's possible that some languages are from a common ancestor, so the majority comes from the huge number of 
     daughters of that ancestor. 
     - Attention needs to be paid to phonetic features, not the sounds themselves as atoms. 
     Example: the case of *sound correspondence 2* in the *Factoring in features held in common* section.
4. Determine the status of overlapping sound correspondence
