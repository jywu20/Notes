# 概述

- “名词性”的从句
- 关系从句
  - 限定性关系从句
  - 非限定性关系从句（广义的同位语从句）
  - maximalizing

关系从句的显著特点是从句中有gap，也就是说被修饰的成分可以回填到从句中。前两类关系从句的区分是显然的：

I spoke to the lecturers who failed the qualification test.  = for every lecturer who failed the qualification test, I spoke to he/she.

I spoke to the lectures, who failed the qualification test. = I spoke to a bunch of lectures, and by the way they failed the qualification test.

第三类关系从句的例子： I spilled the coffee
