It seems many occurrences of topology in condensed matter physics are not that related.

On how a gauge field emerges from a quantum dimer state: Fradkin 

Chern-Simons theory is actually not that strange. By putting a liquid (in the everyday sense) in a magnetic field, 
we can naturally get a Chern-Simons effective theory. Susskind 2012
