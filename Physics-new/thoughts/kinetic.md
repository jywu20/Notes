Truncation in BBGKY hierarchy almost always introduce thermalization. This is expected because scattering 
in a many-body system always make particles correlated, and ignoring a high-order correlation function 
means throwing away useful information.

"Quantization of a kinetic equation" usually makes sense when the kinetic equation is linear, because 
in this case what we get is a type of stable density excitations, and there are of course operators 
of the excitations. In this way, the distribution function of the kinetic equation may be viewed
as the density operator of the excitation, and formally we have quantized the kinetic equation.
The process is more appropriately called (hydrodynamic) bosonization.

In the introduction part of 
Coordinate shift in the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and the anomalous Hall effect,
the authors claim that 
> The semiclassical Eq. (1) is very powerful since it automatically takes care of the summation of various infinite series of Feynman diagrams that appear in quantum linear response theory, and it keeps the physical meaning of all terms transparent.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1301.pdf claims that Boltzmann equation is in essence Kadanoff-Baym equations.

https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.58.323 is a rigorous derivation 
of Boltzmann equation in a condensed matter physics context.

Quantum Kinetics in Transport and Optics of Semiconductors is said to be a more intuitive introduction.

The key point here, however, is I need to know how to map the collision integral 
to the vertex function, or vice versa.
