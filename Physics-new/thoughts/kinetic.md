Truncation in BBGKY hierarchy almost always introduce thermalization. This is expected because scattering 
in a many-body system always make particles correlated, and ignoring a high-order correlation function 
means throwing away useful information.

"Quantization of a kinetic equation" usually makes sense when the kinetic equation is linear, because 
in this case what we get is a type of stable density excitations, and there are of course operators 
of the excitations. In this way, the distribution function of the kinetic equation may be viewed
as the density operator of the excitation, and formally we have quantized the kinetic equation.
The process is more appropriately called (hydrodynamic) bosonization.
