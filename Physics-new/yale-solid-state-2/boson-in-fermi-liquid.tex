\title{Bosonic modes in Fermi liquid}

\section{Introduction}

The Fermi liquid theory can be justified by diagrammatic resummation: 

But interaction channels beside forward scattering 
that come from Coulomb interaction do not just disappear;
they are still a part of the Hamiltonian
and will contribute to the specific heat 
when the system is heated up.
Thus, it can be expected that a real condensed matter system 
that is said to be in a Fermi liquid phase 
contains more than electron-like quasiparticles. 

Characterization of the full spectrum of a system is 
generally only possible for exactly solvable systems. 
This report is constrained on bosonic modes in Fermi liquid,%
\footnote{
    There is a terminological confusion here: 
    the term \term{Fermi liquid} may refer to 
    a system whose Hamiltonian is exactly in the shape of 
    Fermi liquid energy functional,
    or it may refer to a system 
    in which the behavior of electron Green function 
    follows the Fermi liquid theory, 
    but may contain other excitations.
    This note uses the latter definition;
    thus the phrase ``a Fermi liquid'' 
    is a shorthand for ``a real-world condensed matter system 
    demonstrating Fermi liquid behaviors in its single-electron part''.
}
or to be specific, on excitations that are oscillation modes of 
operators with the shape of $c^\dagger_{\vb*{k} + \vb*{q} / 2} c_{\vb*{k} - \vb*{q} / 2}$.
Three-electron behaviors do exist TODO: trion 
but is beyond the scope of this report.

\section{Landau kinetic equation of neutral Fermi liquid}


Boltzmann equation can be derived using 

The most generalized derivation involves Keldysh field theory 
and is beyond the scope of this note; 
we only emphasize here that the derivation 
depends on gradience expansion 
and that the quasiparticle picture works well in the system 
so that the spectral function is approximately 
\begin{equation}
    A(\vb*{k}, \omega) = \delta(\omega - \Re \Sigma(\vb*{k}, \omega)),
\end{equation}
where the imaginary part of the self-energy is ignored 
in the spectral function,
but appears in the collision integral on the RHS.
The second assumption is by definition satisfied with a Fermi liquid;
the first assumption 
however imposes a fundamental constraint 
on the coverage of the quantum Boltzmann equation
to some of well-attested phenomena in Fermi liquid
(\prettyref{sec:microscopic-bosonic-modes}). 

It should be noted that the aforementioned procedure 
does not impose any constraint on $\Re \Sigma$;
specifically, it does not dictate that $\Re \Sigma$
cannot have explicit dependence on $G(\vb*{r}, \vb*{r}', t, t')$, 
and hence $f(\vb*{r}, \vb*{p}, t)$.
We can then insert the Fermi liquid effective energy
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_{\vb*{p} \sigma} = \varepsilon^0_{\vb*{p} \sigma} + 
    \frac{1}{V} \sum_{\vb*{p}', \sigma'} f_{\vb*{p} \vb*{p}' \sigma \sigma'} \var{n}_{\vb*{p}' \sigma'}
    \label{eq:landau-eq-assumption}
\end{equation}
into the quantum Boltzmann equation;
the resulting equation system is called \term{Landau equation}.
Since now $\var{n}$ has both $\vb*{p}$ and $\vb*{r}$ dependence,
$\varepsilon_{\vb*{p}}$ also has $\vb*{r}$ dependence.
No spatial dependence is added to $f_{\vb*{p} \vb*{p}'}$, however:
the fact that $n_{\vb*{k} \vb*{q}}$ has a non-zero value when $\vb*{q} \neq 0$
is due to external electromagnetic driving, 
which at the linear level does not change
the momentum conservation condition 
where an interaction line meets with two electron lines.

In the 

When the temperature is non-zero,
$\tau \propto 1 / T^2$ is finite 
and zero sound faces strong damping 
when its frequency is too slow.
However, in the low frequency region another bosonic mode is possible:
ordinary sound or ``first sound'',
which is a density 

It should be noted that the spectrum of first sound 
is connected to the spectrum of zero sound:
In this sense we may say first sound is 
zero sound with finite temperature correction, 
but this correction is so severe that the qualitative physical picture 
is radically changed.

\section{Microscopic bosonic modes beyond the Landau equation}\label{sec:microscopic-bosonic-modes}

Not all bosonic modes can be obtained 
by observing oscillation modes of quantum Boltzmann equation,
since the latter only works for 
excitations with a large characteristic length scale 
in the $\vb*{x}_1 - \vb*{x}_2$ variable.
This constraint has two consequences.

First, it requires that $\vb*{q}$ is small enough.
When a uniform electric field is applied, 
it influences $\vb*{x}_1 - \vb*{x}_2$, not $(\vb*{x}_1 + \vb*{x}_2) / 2$;
accordingly, it influences $\vb*{k}$, 
which is now to be understood as the \emph{relative} momentum 
between the electron and the hole 
(absence of an electron with momentum $\vb*{k}$ 
is equivalent to existence of a hole with momentum $- \vb*{k}$).
If, however, the electric field has very strong spatial variance, 
the electron at $\vb*{r}_1$ feels a different force 
from that felt at $\vb*{r}_2$,
and the electron-hole pair gets driven as a whole,
giving a non-zero value to $\vb*{q}$.
Thus the small-$\vb*{q}$ condition is equivalent to 
the condition that the wave length of the driving electric field 
should be small compared with the atomic length scale.

Second, it rules out the possibility 
for the naive quantum Boltzmann equation to faithfully represent 
inter-band phenomena.
For a single-band problem, 
we can manually find a ``position'' operator $\vb*{x}$ as the conjugate variable 
of the lattice momentum $\vb*{k}$,
which represents the center of the wave packet 
and in the coarse-grained macroscopic limit 
appears to be the commonly known position;
this definition of $\vb*{x}$ however depends on the 
shape of the band wave function,
and when there exist several bands, 
this procedure is not longer applicable.
In the multi-band case the band Hamiltonians 
$H_1$ and $H_2$ (TODO: ref) should be compared directly,
both of which have atomic characteristic length scale 
and gradience expansion fails.
Another perspective to see the infeasibility to have 
a semi-classical picture for a multi-band problem 
is by directly observing the equation 
governing exciton energy,
which contains $\varepsilon^{\text{c}}_{\vb*{k} + \vb*{q}} - \varepsilon^{\text{v}}_{\vb*{k}}$.
Should the two energies be both from a single band, 
gradience expansion is possible when $\vb*{q}$ is small, 
which leads to the $\pdv{\varepsilon_{\vb*{k}}}{\vb*{k}} \pdv{n}{\vb*{r}}$ term;
for an exciton however this is not the case.
Thus the quantum Boltzmann equation outlined above 
is unable to describe an exciton mode.
This does not mean the quantum Boltzmann equation is useless for excitons:
excitons are usually modeled as independent particles themselves
\emph{besides} electrons,
and exciton formation is modeled as 
a three-particle vertex \cite{klimontovich1981quantum},
while 

\cite{pines2018theory}.
We may say zero sound/plasmon is a \emph{hydrodynamic} mode,
