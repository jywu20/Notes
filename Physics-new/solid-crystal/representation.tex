\section{Overview of representations of finite groups}

\subsection{The characteristic table}

The \concept{character} of a group element in a representation
is defined as its trace.
Thus the character of $e$ (i.e. the identity transform) is 
the dimension of the representation space.

Because $\trace{g a g^{-1}} = \trace{g^{-1} g a} = \trace{a}$, we have

\begin{quotebox*}{Character of conjugacy class}{}
    The characters of all elements in a conjugacy class are the same.
    (But having the same character doesn't mean two elements are in one conjugacy class.)
\end{quotebox*}

The \concept{character table} is square, because

\begin{quotebox*}{Number of irreducible representations}{}
    The number of conjugacy classes is the same as the number of irreducible representations.
\end{quotebox*}

Notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The order of group $G$, i.e. the total number of elements it contains: $n$.
    \item $p, q$ refer to labels of irreducible representations.
    \item $g$ refers to a group element.
    \item $\chi^{(p)}(g)$ is the character of $g$ in representation $p$.
    \item $[g]$ is the conjugacy class containing $g$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{quotebox*}{The great orthogonality theorem}{}
    First,
    \[
        \frac{1}{n} \sum_{g \in G} \chi^{(p)}(g)^* \chi^{(q)}(g) = \delta_{pq}.
    \]
    Second, when $g$ and $g'$ are in the same conjugacy class,
    \[
        \frac{1}{n} \sum_p \chi^{(p)}(g)^* \chi^{(p)}(g') = \frac{1}{\abs*{[g]}},
    \]
    or otherwise the LHS vanishes.

    The second equation consequently means that the character table,
    if viewed as a matrix, is full rank.
\end{quotebox*}

The size of the conjugacy class of $e$ is always 1,
and therefore from the second equation above, we have 

\begin{quotebox*}{Burnside theorem}{}
    Suppose $d_p$ is the dimension of the representation space of representation $p$.
    \[
        \sum_p d_p^2 = n.
    \]
\end{quotebox*}

One usage of the character table:

\begin{quotebox*}{Equivalent representations}
    Two representations are equivalent if and only if they have the same characters.
\end{quotebox*}

\subsection{Representation of a group on a vector space}

In physics we work with wave functions, operators, Hamiltonians, etc.
We should note that when we say that a system has a symmetry $G$,
it means for all operations $U$ in $G$ (or more precisely,
in the representation of $G$ on the Hilbert space),
\begin{equation}
    \mel{\psi}{H}{\varphi} = \mel{\psi}{U^\dag H U}{\varphi} \text{ for all $\ket*{\psi}, \ket*{\varphi}$} \Leftrightarrow H = U^\dag H U,
    \label{eq:sym-of-h}
\end{equation}
and \emph{not}
\[
    \mel{\psi}{H}{\varphi} = \mel{\psi}{U^\dag U H U^\dag U}{\varphi},
\]
because the latter is trivial true:
it's like saying ``when I rotate the system (i.e. $H$) and I rotate my experimental configurations (i.e. $\ket*{\psi}$), the responses stay the same'' --
of course they \emph{have to} say the same.
A non-trivial claim would be something like ``when I rotate my system, while \emph{not} rotating my lab setup, magically all outputs are the same''
-- which is precisely \eqref{eq:sym-of-h}.

\subsection{Scalar, vector, tensor representations}\label{sec:tensor-group-rep}

\begin{quotebox*}{Decomposition of tensor products}{}
    Because $\trace{D_1(g) \otimes D_2(g)} = \trace{D_1(g)} \trace{D_2(g)}$
    for any group element $g$,
    the coefficients in 
    \begin{equation*}
        D_1(g) \otimes D_2(g) = \sum_p a_p D_p(g)
    \end{equation*}
    can be calculated by solving the equation system
    \begin{equation*}
        \chi_{D_1}(g) \chi_{D_2}(g) = \sum_{p} a_p \chi_p(g)
    \end{equation*}
    for all conjugacy classes $[g]$.
    Note that the RHS is full-rank, and the equation has a unique solution.
\end{quotebox*}

\subsection{Projection operator}

When dealing with composite systems, or when carrying out symmetry analysis of the Hamiltonian using \eqref{eq:sym-of-h},
we want to have an explicit expression of how a reducible representation is related to a series of irreducible representations.
This can be done by the so-called projection operators.

TODO: frequency of subspace

\begin{quotebox*}{Projection operators}{}
    Suppose $D$ is a reducible representation.
    The operator 
    \[
        P_p = \frac{d_p}{n} \sum_{g \in G} \chi_p(g^{-1}) D(g)
    \]
    gives the representation space of irreducible representation $p$.
\end{quotebox*}

\section{Mulliken symbols}

Representations of a group may be labeled as $A_1$, $B_g$, or things like that.
This is known as the \concept{Mulliken symbols}.

The A, B, E symbols mean the follows:

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Letter notation of dimension}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{dimension} & \textbf{Mulliken symbol} \\ \midrule
        1                  & A and B                  \\
        2                  & E                        \\
        3                  & T                        \\
        4                  & G                        \\
        5                  & H                        \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The distinction between A and B shows the sign of $\chi(c_n)$,
where $c_n$ represents rotation along the principal axis.

When an $c_2$ axis or a palne of reflection or a $\sigma_v$ plane of reflection,
we use subscripts $1,2$ to indicate if a sign change follows after this operation.
Similarly, $g$ and $u$ means $\chi(i) = \pm 1$, respectively.
Finally, $\chi(\sigma_h)$ is represented by $'$ ($+1$) or $''$ ($-1$).

\section{How things changes under point group operations}\label{sec:how-things-change}

Point group operations naturally have a representation in the 3D Euclidean space.
This representation may be reducible:
in this case, different irreducible representations act on different subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

We cannot know which subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ an irreducible representation acts on.
Therefore in reference books, the standard character table
is often augmented by what carries a representation.

Moreover, we note that some irreducible representations \emph{cannot} be 
written as components of the natural representation on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
The trivial identical representation of $D_{3h}$,
for instance, doesn't correspond to how any subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ changes:
we have $\sigma_h$ and it's not possible to let $z$ stay unchanged.
These representations however can be carried by polynomials of $x, y, z$.

Another type of objects that often carry irreducible representations of a point group
are infinitesimal rotations along the $x, y, z$ axes, usually referred to as $R_{x, y, z}$.
The representations take the form of 
\begin{equation}
    D(g) R_i D^\dag(g) = \sum_j M_{ij}(g) R_j,
\end{equation}
where $M_{ij}(g)$ is the irreducible representation of $g$.

\href{http://symmetry.constructor.university/}{This website} 
contains the extended character table of each point group,
which contains \shortcode{linear functions, rotations}
\shortcode{quadratic functions} and \shortcode{cubic functions} columns.

\section{Symmetry of dielectric tensor}

In optics, $\vb*{q}$ is usually small,
and TODO: analyticity of $\epsilon$

\section{Optics in hexagonal crystals}

Suppose we are dealing with a hexagonal system with $D_{6h}$.
From the (extended; \prettyref{sec:how-things-change}) character table,
we find that the $A_{2u}$ irreducible representation acts on the $z$ component,
while the $E_{1u}$ irreducible representation acts on the $x, y$ components in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
These can be known by consulting the character table \href{http://symmetry.constructor.university/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=606&option=4}{here}.
Thus the representation of $D_{6h}$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 
\begin{equation}
    D = E_{1u} \oplus A_{2u}.
    \label{eq:d-6h-r3-rep}
\end{equation}
This is also given by the \shortcode{dipole (p)} section of 
\href{http://symmetry.constructor.university/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=606&option=4}{the webpage above}.
Note that strictly speaking, \eqref{eq:d-6h-r3-rep} does not track which components the representations act on:
we need to keep that in mind ourselves.

Because we're working with optics, the wave length is assumed to be long enough,
and in utilizing \eqref{eq:sym-of-h} (where the wave functions are replaced by
electric field configurations, or ``single-photon wave functions''),
we can ignore the real space transform and focus on how components of $\vb*{E}$
are mixed together.
Thus \eqref{eq:sym-of-h} means that for all $g \in D_{6h}$,
\begin{equation}
    \vb*{\epsilon} = D^\dag(g) \vb*{\epsilon} D(g).
\end{equation}

The RHS transforms as a rank-2 tensor. (TODO: covariant and contravariant indices?)
The representation of $D_{6h}$ it carries is $D \otimes D$.
Note that the two $D$'s cannot be exchanged,
as the first acts on the first indices of $\epsilon_{ij}$,
while the second acts on the second indices.
Keeping the meaning of being before and after $\otimes$,
and that $E_{1u}$ acts on the $x, y$ component and $A_{2u}$ acts on the $z$ component
(note that we have a natural $z$ direction,
which is parallel to the $C_6$ axis),
we have 
\begin{equation}
    D \otimes D = (A_{2u} \otimes A_{2u}) \oplus 
    (A_{2u} \otimes E_{1u}) \oplus
    (E_{1u} \otimes A_{2u}) \oplus
    (E_{1u} \otimes E_{1u}).
\end{equation}

The next step is to see how the four tensor products 
act on the nine components of $\vb*{\epsilon}$,
following the procedure in \prettyref{sec:tensor-group-rep}.

\paragraph*{The $\epsilon_{zz}$ subspace}
We first notice that the absolute values of all characters of $A_{2u}$ is 1,
and hence the characters of $A_{2u} \otimes A_{2u}$ are all 1,
meaning that 
\begin{equation}
    A_{2u} \otimes A_{2u} = A_{1g},
\end{equation}
i.e. the trivial representation.
This immediately means that the $\epsilon_{zz}$ component is constant
regardless of whatever operations applied to the system.

\paragraph*{The $(\epsilon_{xz}, \epsilon_{yz})$ subspace}
By calculating the characters we also find 
\begin{equation}
    E_{1u} \otimes A_{2u} = E_{1g}.
\end{equation}
This means the $\epsilon_{xz}, \epsilon_{yz}$ components transform as $E_{1g}$.
Actually, once we realize that one irreducible representation acts on the $x, y$ coordinates
and another acts on the $z$ coordinate,
we should realize that $\epsilon_{xz}, \epsilon_{yz}$
transforms in the same way as $xz, yz$ does:
in the latter, the first variable ($x$ or $y$) feels the action of $E_{1u}$,
and the second variable ($z$) feels the action of $A_{2u}$.
So indeed in \href{http://symmetry.constructor.university/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=606&option=4}{the character table}
we find that $E_{1g}$ acts on the space spanned by 
linearly recombining quadratic functions $(xz, yz)$.

Now, from \eqref{eq:sym-of-h}, we have 
\begin{equation}
    E_{1g}(g) \pmqty{\epsilon_{xz} \\ \epsilon_{yz}} = \pmqty{\epsilon_{xz} \\ \epsilon_{yz}},
    \label{eq:hexagonal-xz-yz}
\end{equation}
for all $g \in D_{6h}$.
Because we know $E_{1g}$ is $D_{6h}$'s action on the linear space spanned by $(xz, yz)$,
it immediately follows that 
\begin{equation}
    E_{1g}(c_6) = \pmqty{
        \frac{1}{2} & - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
        \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & \frac{1}{2}
    },
\end{equation}
and from that we find that the linear equation system in \eqref{eq:hexagonal-xz-yz}
only has a vanishing solution.
This means in a hexagonal system, $\epsilon_{xz} = \epsilon_{yz} = 0$.

Following the same logic it can be shown that 
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{xz} = \epsilon_{yz} = \epsilon_{zx} = \epsilon_{zy} = 0.
\end{equation}
What we have shown here is that the subspace of $\vb*{\epsilon}$ that carries the 
$E_{1u} \otimes A_{2u}$ representation can't satisfy so many requirements from \eqref{eq:sym-of-h},
and everything has to vanish.

\paragraph*{The $\epsilon_{x/y, x/y}$ subspace}

The representation targeting the $\epsilon_{x/y, x/y}$ subspace is 
\begin{equation}
    E_{1u} \otimes E_{1u} = A_{1g} \oplus A_{2g} \oplus E_{2g}.
\end{equation}
This is a complicated decomposition and it's not straightforward
to see what each irreducible representation targets.

Fortunately, in this specific case, we do not need to explicitly use the projection operator.
If we go to the \href{http://symmetry.constructor.university/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=606&option=4}{character table of $D_{6h}$},
we notice that $(x^2 + y^2)$ carries irreducible representation $A_{1g}$,
$(x^2 - y^2, xy)$ carries irreducible representation $E_{2g}$,
while $R_z$ carries irreducible representation $A_{2g}$.
We note that
