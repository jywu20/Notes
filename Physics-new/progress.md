# Interesting topics on quantum kinetics

- Landau damping, in Landau equation
- wave function version of GW
- Why there is no landau damping for excitons 
  (comment: exciton lifetime generally comes from electron-phonon scattering, 
  i.e. scattering with thermalized phonons; 
  recombination is usually not that frequent)
- Plasmon in BSE (note: in BGW the q->0 singularity is removed and thus plasmon can be expected to disappear)
- Effective mass and renormalization factor
-  Landau-Zener formula
- Related issues:  What's the correct way to capture "damping without collison (damping with conserved entropy)" - example: Landau damping; possible example: first sound damping (because of lack of collison, damping happens)? How is first sound compared with phonons in solid (which can also be derived from free energy)?  - possible approach: kinetic->hydrodynamics->thermodynamics
Casimir force
- Why phonon frequency is simply corrected by epsilon

- Comparison with TDDFT
- When the retardation is strong and can't be ignored 
- Comparison with experiment - see the note in the introduction of Gruning and Attaccalite
  The role of electron-hole interaction: band gap opening, for example; what are similar observations in optical response?

Few-particle quantum dynamics–comparing nonequilibrium Green functions with the generalized Kadanoff–Baym ansatz to density operator theory : comparing NEGF and density operator formalism 
Generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz for deriving quantum transport equations: cited as the source of GKBA but doesn't really contain anything about density matrix EOM
Long and short time quantum dynamics I: Between Green’s functions and transport equations : provides a proof of the master equation for the density matrix from NEGF EOM
 
# Interpreting the results of quantum kinetics 
 
- Why time-resolved ARPES spectrum is just the Wigner transform of G^<(t_1, t_2) (or G^>, depending on whether we are working on the conduction bands or valence bands)?
- This question is relevant to how to find ``dynamic'' magnetic response, 
  which gives us Lande $g$ factor of excitons
