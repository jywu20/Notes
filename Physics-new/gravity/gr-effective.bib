abstract = {The existence of long range macroscopic attractive forces between masses implies the existence of a mediating helicity ± 2 particle in special relativistic quantum particle theory. It is shown that this fact alone, without assuming the existence of an underlying tensor field, uniquely determines the long wavelength structure of quantum gravitation to be that of Einstein's theory. This equivalence is shown by deriving, from the Ward identities associated with the graviton propagator, the tree graph structure of the graviton-graviton and graviton-matter interaction and establishing that the classical Einstein action is the generating functional. Some properties of closed loop effects are also exhibited.}
