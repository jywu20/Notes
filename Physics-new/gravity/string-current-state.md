On 2021.12.2. Yilu Shao told me something about string theory, and I'd better write them down before 
forgetting about it.

String theory's construction:
- assuming a Lorentz background
- the basic degrees of freedom being strings (justified by the requirement of a natural cutoff, but how it is
  actually done involves some technical details)
- the worldsheet of the strings being conformal invariant (to make the inner degrees of freedom trivial enough,
  so that there will not be any hidden degrees of freedom that are not observable by us yet may have magical
  influence to the outer world)
- each string degrees of freedom corresponds to a particle in ordinary quantum theories;
  the many-body theory of strings is *string field theory*; *string theory* itself corresponds to quantum mechanics

It is highly nontrivial to calculate Feynman diagrams in a string field theory. Calculating Feynman diagrams 
in a string theory - which corresponds to scattering theory in quantum mechanics - itself is already very 
difficult. We need to summarize all possible topological configurations, which requires us to know the proper
topological configurations in advance. People can only calculate one loop diagrams in string theory up to now.
This is because a string theory is a many-body theory of a many-body theory.

To avoid Lorentz anomaly, a bosonic string theory is in a $d+1=26$ spacetime. For a single string, if we pick up 
a spacial coordinate and a temporal coordinate we obtain a conformal field theory, and we have 25 conformal field 
theory in a theory with only one string. These theories may satisfy a transformation rule since coordinates are 
covariant.

Adding fermionic strings into the theory involves more technical details. We need to have supersymmetry. 
There is something I didn't fully understand ...

And now we just get a classical string theory. Quantization itself is very painstaking because a string theory 
is full of gauge symmetries, both in the inner degrees of freedom of strings and in the string field theory. 
We must remove these redundancies and then move on.

What we have discussed here is for open strings. Some duality means if open strings are reasonable, so are 
closed strings. So in the end we get 5 kinds of string theories. All these theories are found to be IR theories
of a complete theory, which is called the M theory. We do not have its Lagrangian, and it is possible that 
the theory does not have any Lagrangian: if we have infinite fields in the Lagrangian then the Lagrangian 
itself is divergent and is not a well-defined object. Techniques like conformal bootstrap may be used 
to describe the theory.

Now here are some hints that make people think string theory is a good candidate of quantum gravity. 

Perturbatively speaking, all 5 kinds of string theories are approximation of the M theory, 
and we find supergravity (a theory with supersymmetry and a tensor field) to be IR theories of these 
string theories, and the IR limit of supergravity is linear gravity - a theory about things like 
gravitational wave. We know that general relativity is the only known theory that is reasonable that 
can be coupled to other fields and is self-consistent non-perturbatively. The perturbative IR EFT of 
supergravity is a theory about something quite similar to a metric field, and we believe that the 
non-perturbative IR limit of supergravity is general relativity, and if this is true, we conclude that 
gravitation comes naturally from string theory.

Another good news about string theory is that we can "formally" derive the standard model from a string 
theory. No one has ever used renormalization group to derive SM from a string theory, but we already know
a certain compactification of a string theory gives a supersymmetric version of SM and imposes no constraints
on the parameters. Therefore, if the compactification method is really the correct one (this is like
fractionalization in condensed matter physics: the information is all in the ansatz, and we are not sure 
what ansatz really works) and the supersymmetric particles are heavy enough, then SM is the low energy limit
of a string theory. In particular, particle generations can be explained in this way.

The third good news is that string theory seems to be compatible with existing black hole thermodynamics.
With a simple state counting calculation, the black hole entropy formula can be derived. (This also 
means if string theory works and statistical mechanics is still correct there, then strings are the fundamental
degrees of freedom in our world, or otherwise the state counting will underestimate entropy)

None of the "good news" are strong justification of string theory, though. What we are doing is 
"inverse RG flow", and since string theories have a completely different formalism with QFTs,
this inverse RG flow is just educated guess. We take the example of general relativity. If general
relativity is really the only reasonable gravity theory, then we can imagine that in the space of 
all possible theories, GR is a fixed point and every candidate of theory of everything flows to it.

Also, there still exist a lot of technical difficulties. Remember we do not even know what the M theory 
exactly is! There are most duality results. We already know that M theory can be mapped to a zero-dimensional
matrix model, but the matrix model itself is highly complicated, including infinite terms. It is almost 
impossible to calculate anything from the matrix model. Nor can we obtain an explicit form of M theory.
