- PhysRevMaterials.5.083803 refers to 
  PhysRevB.94.245303 for the derivation of the dynamic spectral function 
  as the Fourier transform of $G^<$.
- Ref. 45, 46 in PhysRevB.94.245303 say
  that virtual excitons can be found at the HF level 
- PhysRevLett.102.136401 is cited in arXiv 2302.01719.

So the general idea is like this: 
by the sudden approximation, 
we assume that there is almost no Coulomb interaction 
between bands near $E_\text{F}$
(denoted by $v$) 
and high-energy bands (denoted by $f$); 
thus the Green function EOM connecting 
$G^<_{ff}$ and $G^<_{vv}$ is almost trivial: 
there are two time evolution operators turning $v$ indices to $f$ indices, 
and that's all.
The time evolution operators definitely involve $\vb{p} \cdot \vb{A}$, 
which in turn involves $\ee^{-\ii \omega t}$; 
so we get the Fourier transform expression for $G^<_{ff}$, 
which gives the intensity of electrons 
that can be kicked out by the probe pulse; 
the final output intensity is therefore 
proportional to some kind of Fourier transform of $G^<_{vv}$.
