	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {We review the dynamics of supercooled liquids approaching the liquid-glass transition, starting with the conventional generalized hydrodynamics formulation. Empirical models for the memory function are discussed, as are empirical models for the self-energy function for phonons in crystals. Two examples of microscopic analyses based on non-linear interactions are then described, the anharmonic lattice dynamics model for structural phase transitions, and Kawasaki's mode-mode-coupling approach for critical dynamics. We then review the mode-coupling theory of the liquid-glass transition, emphasizing its relation to generalized hydrodynamics with the memory function derived from a microscopic theory of non-linear interactions. We discuss the major predictions of this theory, particularly the asymptotic expansion results, which provide specific formulae for analysing experimental data.}

	title = {Dynamical quantum phase transitions: A brief survey},
	journal = {{EPL} (Europhysics Letters)},
	abstract = {Nonequilibrium states of closed quantum many-body systems defy a thermodynamic description. As a consequence, constraints such as the principle of equal a priori probabilities in the microcanonical ensemble can be relaxed, which can lead to quantum states with novel properties of genuine nonequilibrium nature. In turn, for the theoretical description it is in general not sufficient to understand nonequilibrium dynamics on the basis of the properties of the involved Hamiltonians. Instead it becomes important to characterize time-evolution operators, which adds time as an additional scale to the problem. In this perspective article we summarize recent progress in the field of dynamical quantum phase transitions, which are phase transitions in time with temporal nonanalyticities in matrix elements of the time-evolution operator. These transitions are not driven by an external control parameter, but rather occur due to sharp internal changes generated solely by unitary real-time dynamics. We discuss the obtained insights on general properties of dynamical quantum phase transitions, their physical interpretation, potential future research directions, as well as recent experimental observations.}
