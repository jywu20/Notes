The expression of $n_{b_2}$ 
in the subspace of \eqref{eq:coherent-plus-squeeze}
after normal ordering and replacement of $a_1$ by $\alpha$ is 
\begin{equation}
    n_{b_2} \simeq \abs*{\alpha}^2 \sin^2 \varphi + \cos^2 \varphi n_{a_2} 
    - \ii \sin \varphi \cos \varphi (\alpha^* a_2 - \alpha a_2^\dagger).
\end{equation}
The expression of $n_{b_2}^2$ can be simplified similarly,
though in a more complicated manner.
Note that \eqref{eq:coherent-plus-squeeze} does not contain any cross terms between $a_1$ and $a_2$,
so all terms in \eqref{eq:nb2-sq-def} that induce hopping from $a_1$ to $a_2$ (or the inverse) 
vanish in the subspace of \eqref{eq:coherent-plus-squeeze}.
Thus the second line of \eqref{eq:nb2-sq-def} can be thrown away.
The third term in \eqref{eq:nb2-sq-def} is 
\[
    - \sin^2 \varphi \cos^2 \varphi (
        a_1^\dagger a_2 a_1^\dagger a_2 + \text{h.c.}
        - a_1^\dagger a_2 a_2^\dagger a_1 - a_2^\dagger a_1 a_1^\dagger a_2
    ),
\]
and only the last two terms should be kept.
So we have 
\[
    n^2_{b_2} \simeq \sin^4 \varphi (a_1^\dagger a_1)^2 + \cos^4 \varphi (a_2^\dagger a_2)^2
    + \sin^2 \varphi \cos^2 \varphi (a_1^\dagger a_1 a_2 a_2^\dagger + a_2^\dagger a_2 a_1 a_1^\dagger)
    +2 \sin^2 \varphi \cos^2 \varphi a_1^\dagger a_1 a_2^\dagger a_2.
\]
After normal ordering, we replace $a_1$ by $\alpha$, and the final result is 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        n_{b_2}^2 &= \sin^4 \varphi (\abs*{\alpha}^4 + \abs*{\alpha}^2) + \sin^2 \varphi \cos^2 \varphi (2 \abs*{\alpha}^2 P(\alpha)^2 + a_2^\dagger a_2) + 2 \sin^2 \varphi \cos^2 \varphi \abs*{\alpha}^2 a_2^\dagger a_2 \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:nb2-square-mf}
\end{equation}
