But in theory, interactions among particles may allow scaling beyond this limit into 'super-Heisenberg' territory. Napolitano et al. prove experimentally that this can indeed occur in a nonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetization of an atomic ensemble. The work shows that inter-particle interactions could be a useful resource for quantum metrology, although the relative performance of nonlinear versus linear measurements has yet to be explored more generally.},
