abstract = {The correlation functions for density fluctuations yield the basic equations in fluids. The density fluctuations consists of intraband and interband density fluctuations which yield the conventional density and the divergence of the displacement of an atom in a localized potential, respectively. The current consists of the corresponding conventional current and displacement current. The basic equations combined with the continuity equation yield a generalized Navier–Stokes equation, which reduces to the Navier–Stokes equation at low frequencies or high temperatures and to the elastic equation at high frequencies or low temperatures. The transport coefficients, the relaxation times and the velocity of modes obey the Vogel–Fulcher law.}
