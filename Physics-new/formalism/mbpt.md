Many-body perturbation theory as a generic framework in condensed-matter physics - or even more 

# MBPT, zero-temperature 

For excited states, the follows are equivalent:
- Green-function, Feynman diagrams, etc.: based on canonical quantization 
- Green-function, Feynman diagrams, etc.: based on path integral
- Off-shell Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory (time-ordered Goldstone diagrams)
- Time-dependent perturbation theory (also time-ordered Goldstone diagrams)

For the ground state, the follows are equivalent:
- Feynman diagrams, etc.: based on canonical quantization
- Ground state RSPT (textbook level time-independent PT)
- Ground state Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP)

The following formalisms can be understood within the MBPT framework:
- Coupled-cluster
- Density functional; but not Kohn-Sham wave functions

# MBPT, non-equilibrium 

The follows can be understood within the non-equilibrium MBPT:
- quantum master equation, especially the Lindblad equation 
- Boltzmann equation 
- TDDFT: $f_{\text{xc}}$ in principle can be calculated in MBPT

- By planting external field lines into time-dependent single-particle Green function formalisms,
  we can get zero-temperature multi-particle Green function formalisms
