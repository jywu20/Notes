\section{Introduction}

Suppose we are to find the single-particle Green function 
of a condensed matter system.
The standard procedure is to find the irreducible self-energy $\Sigma$
by Feynman diagram resummation
(although there are subtleties 
concerning the well-definedness and uniqueness of Feynman diagram resummation techniques 
\cite{PhysRevLett.119.056402}).
In strongly correlated systems,
deciding diagrams with most contributions is generally hard,
and brutal-force resummation proves intractable.

If, however, it is found that the self-energy 
(or two-particle vertex, or similar ``$n$-particle self-energy diagrams'')
is highly local, 
then in principle,
it can be replicated in a \emph{few-body} model,
although as we are going to see below,
it is just formally few-body:
its most natural form is better described as a \emph{many-body impurity model}.
Suppose, for example, that the real space self-energy $\Sigma_{\vb*{i} \vb*{j}}$ is only important 
when $\abs{\vb*{i} - \vb*{j}} \leq n$.
Then we can just choose a cluster of sites satisfying the $\abs{\vb*{i} - \vb*{j}} \leq n$ condition,
and integrate out the rest of electron modes,
and in the resulting impurity model,
$\Sigma_{\vb*{i} \vb*{j}}$ is exactly the same as in the original model.
The main obstacle now is to decide the parameters in this new impurity model,
which can be solved by adopting a self-consistent scheme:
$\Sigma_{\vb*{i} \vb*{j}}$, together with the free part of the original model,
decides the one-particle Green function,
which then can be used to fit the parameters in the impurity model,
and then the impurity model can be solved to update the self-energy.

It can be seen that diagrammatically speaking, 
this idea is also a resummation strategy,
though here we pick up diagrams according to their \emph{locality} instead of structures,
and the local parts of \emph{all} diagrams, 
as long as they fit in the ansatz of the impurity model,
are included when we solve the impurity model.
This can also be seen as a mean-field approach,
just like other self-consistent Feynman diagram resummation strategies.
Since the parameters in the impurity model may contain time explicitly,
we may say what we are doing is a \emph{dynamic} mean-field theory.

This report reviews the development of dynamic mean-field theory (DMFT).
The term \emph{dynamic mean-field theory} is usually reserved for 
the most coarse approximation with a single-site cluster
and a completely space-independent self-energy
discussed in \prettyref{sec:dmft}.
In \prettyref{sec:more}, we move beyond the simplest DMFT scheme 
and increase the number of sites 
and loose the locality requirement for the self-energy.
\prettyref{sec:ab-initio}
is about combining DMFT and \textit{ab initio} methods together.

\section{DMFT for the Hubbard model}\label{sec:dmft}

\subsection{Duality between the Hubbard model and the Anderson impurity model}

In this section we discuss DMFT for the Hubbard model
\begin{equation}
    H = - t \sum_{\pair{\vb*{i}, \vb*{j}}, \sigma} c^\dagger_{\vb*{i} \sigma} c_{\vb*{j} \sigma} + \text{h.c.}
    + U \sum_{\vb*{i}} n_{\vb*{i} \uparrow} n_{\vb*{j} \downarrow} - \mu N.
\end{equation}
The free part results in the imaginary time Green function
\begin{equation}
    G_{0}(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k} \sigma) = G_0(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k}) , 
    \quad G_0(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k}) = \frac{1}{\ii \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vb*{k}} + \mu},
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{\vb*{k}}$ is the band structure of the tight-binding model part.
Now we map the Hubbard model to an impurity theory.
We keep only one site in the impurity theory
and integrate out the rest, 
and the final effective theory looks like
\begin{equation}
    S_{\text{single site}} = 
    - \int \dd{\tau} \int \dd{\tau'} \bar{c}(\tau) \mathcal{G}^{-1}(\tau - \tau') c(\tau') 
    + \int \dd{\tau} U n_{\uparrow}(\tau) n_{\downarrow}(\tau).
    \label{eq:single-site}
\end{equation}
The Green function $\mathcal{G}(\tau)$ is 
$G_{0, \vb*{i} \vb*{i}}(\tau)$ corrected by the integrated out electronic degrees of freedom;
the local interaction $U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}$ is not included in $\mathcal{G}$.

Note that $\mathcal{G}$ can also be seen as a single-particle Green function 
with self-energy correction,
and therefore has the same structure of 
a self-energy-corrected single-particle Green function,
although its value is different from $G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}$,
because its self-energy is different from the self-energy of the whole Hubbard system,
since the former only considers sites beside $\vb*{i}$
while the latter considers all sites.
Assuming the self-energy of $\mathcal{G}$ is well-behaved
for Hilbert transformation \cite{georges1996dynamical},
we write the structure of $\mathcal{G}$ as  
\[
    \mathcal{G}(\ii \omega_n)^{-1} = 
    \ii \omega_n + \text{const.} + \int \dd{\epsilon} g(\epsilon) \frac{1}{\ii \omega_n - \epsilon},
\]
and this means the single-site model can be instantiated 
by replacing $\mathcal{G}$ by a bath of non-interactive electrons,
the dispersion relations of which 
are decided by poles of $\mathcal{G}$,
and we get an Anderson impurity model
\begin{equation}
    H_{\text{Anderson}} = 
    \underbrace{
        \epsilon_0 \sum_\sigma c_{\sigma}^\dagger c_{\sigma}
        + \sum_{\vb*{k}, \sigma} E_{\vb*{k}} d^\dagger_{\vb*{k} \sigma} d_{\vb*{k} \sigma}
        + \sum_{\vb*{k}} (V_{\vb*{k}} d^\dagger_{\vb*{k} \sigma} c_{\sigma} + \text{h.c.})
    }_{\simeq c^\dagger \mathcal{G} c}
    + U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}.
\end{equation}
The structure of $\mathcal{G}$ is therefore 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{G} (\ii \omega_n) = \frac{1}{\ii \omega_n - \epsilon_0 - \Delta(\ii \omega_n)}, \quad 
    \Delta(\ii \omega_n) = \sum_{\vb*{k}} \frac{\abs{V_{\vb*{k}}}^2}{\ii \omega_n - E_{\vb*{k}}}.
\end{equation}
Note that the influence of $U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}$ is not 
accounted for by $\mathcal{G}$.
Other Hamiltonian realizations of \eqref{eq:single-site} are of course possible
\cite{georges1996dynamical}.
Note that here $\Delta$ contains explicitly $\ii \omega_n$
and therefore has retardation effects 
in the real space.
Therefore \eqref{eq:single-site} contains retardation,
and this is an evidence why it is better to put it into 
the form of a \emph{many-body} impurity model instead of a single-body model.

We use $G_{\text{imp}}$ to refer to the interaction-corrected Green function in the impurity model.
Note that by definition of the mapping, we have 
$G_{\text{imp}}(\ii \omega_n) = G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}(\ii \omega_n)$,
and therefore 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{G}(\ii \omega_n)^{-1} - \Sigma_{\text{imp}}} 
    = {G}_{\text{imp}}(\ii \omega_n) = G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}(\ii \omega_n)
    = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vb*{k}} G(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k})
    = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vb*{k}} \frac{1}{\ii \omega_n - \epsilon_{\vb*{k}} - \Sigma(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k})}.
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the fully corrected Green function in the Hubbard model,
$\Sigma$ is the self-energy of the Hubbard model,
and $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ is the self-energy correction to $\mathcal{G}$
caused by $U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}$.

\subsection{The self-energy locality condition}

The mapping from a Hubbard model to an Anderson impurity model 
involves no physical approximation.
Now we impose the locality condition of the self-energy mentioned in the introduction:
we assume the Hubbard model self-energy $\Sigma(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k})$ 
is highly localized in the real space,
and therefore involves no $\vb*{k}$-dependence,
and thus we immediately get 
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{\text{imp}} = \Sigma(\ii \omega_n \vb*{k}).
    \label{eq:locality}
\end{equation}
This approximation is exact in an infinite lattice \cite{PhysRevB.45.6479},
and therefore expectedly works better for bulk materials than monolayer materials.

\subsection{The self-consistent loop}

The cutoff \eqref{eq:locality} gives us a self-consistent calculation scheme:
first using $G_0$ (known) and $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ (from last iteration), we have 
\begin{equation}
    G(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k}) = \frac{1}{\ii \omega_n - \varepsilon_{\vb*{k}} + \mu - \Sigma_{\text{imp}}(\ii \omega_n)},
\end{equation}
and then we calculate $G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}$ (essentially $G_{\text{imp}}$) by 
\begin{equation}
    G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}(\ii \omega_n) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\vb*{k}} G(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k}),
\end{equation}
and then $\mathcal{G}$ can be found by 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{G}(\ii \omega_n)^{-1} = G_{\vb*{i} \vb*{i}}(\ii \omega_n)^{-1} + \Sigma_{\text{imp}}(\ii \omega_n).
\end{equation}
Now the impurity model is fully determined,
and with $U$ and $\mathcal{G}(\ii \omega_n)$, we solve the model and get $G_{\text{imp}}$.
So now $G_{\text{imp}}$ is updated,
and we can then find the updated $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$, 
and we go back to the starting point of the loop.

Note that here $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ is \emph{not} calculated 
using diagrammatic resummation techniques.
Instead, we find $G_{\text{imp}}$ without explicitly mentioning $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ 
in the impurity solver step, 
and $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ is found \emph{after} $G_{\text{imp}}$ (and $\mathcal{G}$) is known.
This guarantees enough accuracy of $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$:
if it is evaluated in the same way with, say, the $GW$ method,
infinite diagrams are thrown away,
but here \emph{all} Feynman diagrams contributing to $\Sigma_{\text{imp}}$ 
-- and therefore $\Sigma(\ii \omega_n, \vb*{k})$ -- are taken into account;
what is ignored is just their spatial independent parts.

For Hubbard model, the interaction term in the impurity problem is exactly $U n_{\uparrow} n_{\downarrow}$,
because it is strictly local and is not corrected 
when electrons on other sites are integrated out.
For models with nearest-neighbor interaction,
this is no longer correct,
because now integrating out other electron modes 
means screening of the interaction.
An even more important fact about models with repulsion between electrons from different sites 
is the interaction term cannot appear in a single-site model.
To solve the above problems, 
a possible way is to use a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation 
and use an auxiliary boson field to introduce the interaction.
The resulting single-site model 
is in an itinerant electron bath 
and a bosonic bath \cite{sun_extended_2002}.



\section{Going beyond DMFT}\label{sec:more}

Unfortunately, in some scenarios the original single-site DMFT is bound to fail.
This is exemplified in phrase transition,
in which long-wavelength behaviors are highly important,
and a strictly local $\Sigma$ cannot be the case.
A possible direction of improvement is 
to use an impurity dual Hamiltonian involving a larger cluster of states 
\cite{kotliar_cellular_2001,park_cluster_2008}.
The main problem of this approach is the speed:
the impurity model concerning a large impurity cluster has to be solved with high accuracy,
and this is demanding for existing solvers 
\cite{potthoff_cluster_2018,gull_continuous-time_2011}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{feynman/dga.tex}
    \caption{
        Finding the self-energy from the reducible vertex function \cite{bickers1991conserving}.
        A diagram in the self-energy always starts with a Coulomb interaction vertex,
        so all self-energy diagrams can be seen as a Coulomb vertex plus a 
        four-leg diagram (a).
        Here grey lines are external lines, 
        which do not contribute propagator factors and merely provides a momentum value 
        when the diagram is evaluated;
        bold lines are lines with interaction correction,
        like self-energy correction for electron lines.
        When the four-leg diagram is disconnected, we only have two diagrams that are logically possible,
        and we can find they are just the Hartree diagram and the Fock diagram,
        and the propagators inside are modified by self-energy correction (b).
        When there is at least one Coulomb interaction line connecting the upper lines and the lower lines 
        of the four-leg diagram, the four legs have to be linked to four self-energy-corrected electron lines,
        or otherwise the diagram is not well-formed.
        Thus we find the sum of all diagrams besides diagrams in (b) 
        is proportion to the reducible two-particle vertex diagram (c),
        and (a) = (b) + (c) \cite{bickers1991conserving}.
        Specifically, inserting (d) and (e) into the grey box in (c), 
        we get a term in the screening correction 
        (i.e. correction of the interaction line, or ``vacuum polarization'' in terms of particle physics)
        and a term in the vertex correction.
    }
    \label{fig:dga}
\end{figure}

Improvement can also be made by relaxing the strict locality condition for the self-energy,
which leads to the dynamic vertex approximation.
In the dynamic vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A),
we assume that $\Sigma$ is not local,
but the 2-particle vertex $\Gamma$ is local.
The spatial-varying self-energy can then be calculated from $\Gamma$
(\prettyref{fig:dga}). 

\section{DMFT in \textit{ab initio} calculation}\label{sec:ab-initio}

Specifically, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) 
can also be formulated in this framework: 
the Kohn-Sham orbitals are ``wave functions'' 
appearing in the spectral representation of the one-particle Green function,
and the exchange-correlation functional 
is $\Phi$ in terms of the electron number density.
In principle, 
this means the exchange-correlation functional used in DFT
can be improved systematically using Feynman diagrammatic techniques
\cite{aryasetiawan2002total,gruning2006density},
although the infamous semiconductor band gap problem
persists even with an accurate functional,
because we still need to consider the contribution of 
energy functional discontinuity
\cite{gruning2006density}.
