\section{Concepts}

\subsection{The basic assumption of regression: gaussian error, or the like}

Suppose we have \concept{training data} $\{ (X_i, Y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$,
a sampling of random variables $X$ and $Y$.
It's common to call $X$ the \concept{covariate}.

Suppose we want to predict $Y$ from $X$,
by a \concept{prediction} $\hat{Y}$.
When the black block of the physical mechanism behind $X$ and $Y$ is known,
$Y$, when $X = x$, should be predicted by the \concept{regression function}
\begin{equation}
    m(x) = \expect (Y | X = x) = \int y p(y | x) \dd{y}.
\end{equation}
Here we use a slightly sloppy notation and refer to $p(Y = y)$ as $p(y)$, etc.
Note that when $y$ is continuous, $p(y | x)$ should be defined as the 
\emph{probability density}, and $p(y | x) \dd{y}$ is the probability
that $Y$ falls between $y$ and $y + \dd{y}$ when $X = x$.

More often than not, the underlying physical mechanism is not known,
and $m$ can only be estimated from the distribution of the data.
The estimation is labeled as $\hat{m}$.
The \concept{risk} of a prediction $\hat{Y} = \hat{m}(X)$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    R(\hat{m}) = \expect[(Y - \hat{Y})^2].
    \label{eq:risk-def}
\end{equation}
Note that there is no guarantee that it vanishes when $\hat{Y}$ is indeed given
by the one hundred percent accurate $m$,
as there might be other variables contributing to $Y$,
which have their own distributions.

The risk shouldn't be too large for a good prediction.
But whether we should minimize the risk (and not similar quantities) is not a priori clear.
From the perspective of frequentists,
minimization of \eqref{eq:risk-def} implicitly assumes that 
the form of $\hat{m}$ we choose guarantees that 
\begin{equation}
    Y \approx \hat{m}(X) + \mathcal{N},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}$ is a gaussian variable or at least a variable 
for which $p(\mathcal{N} = n) \sim f(n^2)$,
and minimization of the risk function is equivalent to maximal likelihood estimation.
If we add regularization terms to the risk function in minimization,
it means we have more assumptions on the parameters in $\hat{m}$,
which are enforced by the regularization terms.
From the Bayesian perspective, (regularized) minimization of the risk
is equivalent to maximal a posteriori estimation,
in which we have assumed that $p(x, y | \hat{m})$ takes the form of gaussian distribution
or similar $f((x - y)^2)$ distributions.

The current paradigm of statistics research is two-step.
First, estimators are be derived by stipulating a form of $\hat{m}$ and also a form of the risk function
(e.g. the average of the $L^2$ norm between $\hat{m}(x_i)$ and $y_i$).
Second, an estimator, once derived as a logical consequence of these assumptions,
is then treated as a math object -- which \emph{does not} rely on the exact assumptions used to derive it --
and its performances are analyzed under \emph{other} assumptions.
A statistician for example may ask how sure we can be about 
whether the stipulated form of $\hat{m}$ is correct,
given \emph{only} the assumption of sufficient training datasets.
So we have a two-stage workflow:
first, deriving an estimator (in this process the parameters of the estimator are considered 
\emph{unknown constants}, to be determined by minimizing the risk function under certain assumptions),
and second, analyzing properties of the estimator 
(in this process the parameters of the estimator are functions of the training dataset,
and are now \emph{random variables},
and we can calculate their variances, etc. as indicators of how certain we are).

Below, for convenience, we often skip the hat in $\hat{m}$
when the ``true'' regression function is not the focus of the discussion.

\subsection{Bias-variation decomposition}

Here is an instance of how to judge an estimator \emph{after} it's developed.
We assume that the relation between $Y$ and $X$ is 
\begin{equation}
    Y = m(X) + \epsilon,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is a noise term whose expectation vanishes 
and includes all effects not included in $X$.
Now, we calculate the mean square error of the estimator at a given point $x_0$.
Note that this is \emph{not} \eqref{eq:risk-def}:
in \eqref{eq:risk-def}, what is random is $X$,
and the parameters in $\hat{Y} = \hat{m}(X)$ are considered (unknown) constants
to be estimated by minimization of the risk function,
while here, what is random is the training dataset,
and the parameters in $\hat{Y} = \hat{m}(X)$ are functions of the training dataset.
Calculating the mean squared error here is about \emph{having a rough understanding of how good the model is}, not for training.

For an arbitrary $\hat{m}$, the mean square error at a given point $x_0$ is 
\begin{equation}
    \text{MSE} = \expect[(y_0 - \hat{m}(x_0))^2] \coloneqq \expect_{\epsilon, \mathcal{D}}[(y_0 - \hat{m}(x_0))^2].
    \label{eq:mse-post-training}
\end{equation}
We emphasize again here that the random variables here 
are the noise and the randomly selected training dataset $\mathcal{D}$,
and the parameters in $\hat{m}$ are functions of $\mathcal{D}$,
while $x_0$ and $y_0$ are fixed.
\eqref{eq:mse-post-training} is \emph{not} the one used in training,
and is used as an a posteriori index for the performance of the model.
Now we have \concept{bias-variance decomposition}:
\begin{equation}
    \text{MSE at $x_0$} = \mathrm{bias}(x_0)^2 
    + \mathrm{var}(x_0) + \sigma^2,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{bias}(x_0) = \expect_{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{m}(x_0)] - m(x_0)
\end{equation}
is about the shift of the expected prediction given all possible training datasets
from the ideal prediction $m(x_0)$, and
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{var}(x_0) = \mathrm{Var}_{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{m}(x_0)] 
\end{equation}
measures how sensitive the model is to fluctuation of the training dataset
(which shouldn't be overly large),
and 
\begin{equation}
    \sigma^2 = \expect_\epsilon[(y_0 - m(x_0))^2] = \mathrm{Var}[\epsilon^2]
\end{equation}
is the inevitable deviation of the ideally predicted $Y$ from the real $Y$,
which cannot be reduced however we improve our methodology.
$R^* = \sigma^2$ is the lowest possible risk.
The key point to prove the equation is to notice that 
\begin{equation}
    \expect[\epsilon (m(X) - \hat{m}(X))] = 0
\end{equation}
because the noise term's distribution should be independent to the sampling process
and the expectation can be split into the expectations of the two factor
one of which vanishes, and $\expect_{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{m}(x_0)] - m(x_0)$ is a constant
when $\mathcal{D}$ changes.
When we let $x_0$ to change as well, we have
\begin{equation}
    \text{MSE} = \int \mathrm{bias}(x)^2 p(x) \dd{x} 
    + \int \mathrm{var}(x) p(x) \dd{x} + \sigma^2.
\end{equation}

A similar result can be established for the mean square error of the \emph{parameters of the model},
which, similarly, is \emph{not} used for training but instead is used to evaluating the performance of the model after training.
Assuming that the way $\hat{m}$ is parameterized and $\theta$ is the ``correct'' parameter that reproduces $m$,
the decomposition is 
\begin{equation}
    \expect_{\mathcal{D}}[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2] = \underbrace{\expect_{\mathcal{D}}[(\hat{\theta} - \expect_{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\theta}])^2]}_{\text{bias}} + \underbrace{(\expect_{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\theta}] - \theta)^2}_{\text{variance}}.
    \label{eq:theta-post-train}
\end{equation}

\section{Low dimensional linear regression}

Consider a \concept{linear predicator}
\begin{equation}
    m(x) = \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i x_i,
    \label{eq:linear}
\end{equation}
where $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_p) $ is a \emph{single} $x$.
When the difference between $m(x)$ in \eqref{eq:linear} and $Y$ is clearly a gaussian distribution,
and there are enough samples,
$\beta$ can be calculated by minimizing 
\begin{equation}
    \text{training error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta^\top x_i)^2,
\end{equation}
which is an estimation of the risk function.
The resulting minimizer
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\beta} = (\vb{X}^\top \vb{X})^{-1} \vb{X}^\top \vb{Y},
    \label{eq:lsq-estimation}
\end{equation}
where $\vb{X}_{n \times p}$ is defined by 
\begin{equation}
    X_{ij} = \text{the $j$ the component of the sample $x_i$}
\end{equation}
is called the \concept{least squares estimator}, and 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}^\top X.
\end{equation}

\eqref{eq:lsq-estimation} definitely works when the condition of gaussian error term and 
the condition of sufficiently large training dataset are satisfied.
Whether it works when these conditions are \emph{not necessarily} satisfied is a non-trivial question.
A statistician wants to know when the two conditions are weakened,
from the distribution of the training dataset,
how sure we can be about whether \eqref{eq:lsq-estimation} works.
In these discussions, \eqref{eq:lsq-estimation} is \emph{no longer a logical consequence of given assumptions},
but a math object on its own, an \emph{estimator},
which is derived heuristically but does not always rely on its assumptions to work.
This is what the mathematical theory of statistics is about:
using some assumptions to derive estimators,
and see that under weakened assumptions how we can evaluate its performances.

\section{High dimensional linear regression: Ridge regression}

When $p \gg n$, things become bad: now $\vb{X}^\top \vb{X}$ can't be full rank,
and hence is not invertible.
So \eqref{eq:lsq-estimation} fails.
What's the origin of the failure?
Quantitatively it is because the variance of the least squares predication is huge.
From the perspective of \eqref{eq:theta-post-train},
this means the variance is undesirably large,
and we need to ``increase'' the bias so that the variance can be reduced.
Ideally, the bias should not actually increased,
so regularization naturally emerges as a choice.

We try 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\beta} = \argmin_{\beta} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta^\top x_i)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{n} \| \beta \|^2_2,
    \label{eq:ridge-min}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    \| \beta \|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_j \beta_j^2}.
\end{equation}
The solution is 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\beta} = (\vb{X}^\top \vb{X} + \lambda I)^{-1} \vb{X}^\top \vb{Y}.
\end{equation}
Increasing $\lambda$ dictates reduction of $\beta$'s complexity,
as $\lambda = \infty \Rightarrow \hat{\beta} = 0$.
This is known as \concept{Ridge regression}.

The value of $\lambda$ should be chosen by minimizing the RHS of \eqref{eq:ridge-min}.
