$$
\frac{\delta F}{\delta f(x)} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{F[f(x') + \epsilon \delta(x-x')] - F[f(x')]}{\epsilon}

# Variation of the action
Let there be a set of fields $\phi$ defined on a given manifold. The principle of least action is applied, where the action is given as an integral of a Lagrangian over the whole manifold.  

$$
S = \int \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi, x^\mu) \mathrm{d}^n x.
$$

Coordinates have the role of independent variables, and field variables are dependent variables.

## Calculation of the variation
Since in the set of fields in question there may be one or more tensor fields, we introduce the following notation 
$$
S = \int \mathcal{L}(\phi^i, \nabla_\mu \phi^i, x^\mu) \mathrm{d}^n x.
$$
where the index $i$ ranges over various components of various tensor fields.

Under an infinitesimal transformation, for independent variables we have
$$
x^\mu \rightarrow \tilde{x}^\mu = x^\mu + \delta x^\mu
$$

$$
\phi^i (x^\mu) \rightarrow \tilde{\phi}^{i} (\tilde{x}^\mu) = 
$$

The least action principle stipulates that in a real world fields must take proper distributions such that
$$
\delta S = 0.
$$

$$
\int (\mathcal{L} + \partial_\mu \Lambda^\mu) \mathrm{d}^n x = \int \mathcal{L} \mathrm{d}^n x + \int \mathrm{d}s_i \Lambda^i
$$
